//! What a map gives a preview: the materials its submeshes name, the particles and
//! characters it stands, and which map an object of a map's own classes draws.
//!
//! A map's geometry rides the `ltk-asset` scheme as one `LTKM` buffer and never crosses
//! IPC, so this module answers only the other half, which is the `StaticMaterialDef`
//! behind each material path that buffer carries. Both of a map's files derive from one
//! [`MapPath`] (ADR-0044).
