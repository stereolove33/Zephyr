//! claim about one game build: it is right or wrong forever for that build, and
//! it never drifts the way a live feed does. That is why it ships in the build
//! rather than being fetched - and why a wrong hash, which is not recoverable
//! from the file it was written into, is a thing to review before it ships.
//!
//! Both `class` and `field` are a name or a hash. A name hashes to the other
//! form with `FNV1a32(lowercase)`, which is what the format itself does, so the
//! loader hashes every name once and the table becomes one lookup.
