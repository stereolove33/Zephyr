//! `vfx/per-frame-random` and `vfx/broken-random` - probability tables the
//! game re-rolls every frame, or cannot read.
//!
//! An animated value's `dynamics` holds `probabilityTables`, one table per
//! channel, which a particle's birth reads at one roll.
//!
//! - The per-frame evaluate passes no roll, so a table on a per-frame value
//!   draws afresh every frame and every channel. That is attested for
//!   `Color` and `scale0`, so the rule names those two alone.
//! - A null slot after a held first slot is dereferenced unchecked, and two
//!   lists of different lengths read as 0.
//!
//! Neither offers a repair, because which value the author meant is not in the
//! file.
