//! Applying the fixes a user chose.

//! A `File` does not name its path. Once a fix has written the hash, the string
//! is gone from the file and no reader can derive it back, so a run keeps every
//! path it hashes in the project's own tables first - `preserve`. That is what
//! makes a repair keep every name, and it is why there is no restore point:
//! see ADR-0006. Fidelity is a separate promise, and a per-rule one - ADR-0011.
//!
//! A run over a tree lands each file through a temp file in its own directory
//! and then a rename. A run that dies mid-way leaves whole files on both sides
//! of it, and the ones it finished read the same as if it had finished. A run
//! over an archive lands nothing: it holds every write for the edit that puts
//! them back - ADR-0025.
