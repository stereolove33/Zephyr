//! What bounds a concurrent run: bytes in flight, not threads.
//!
//! A parsed `Bin` is several times its size on disk, so a pool sized by thread
//! count is a pool that pages the moment it lands on a 40MB mod. The unit that
//! actually has to be bounded is memory, and the count of workers only decides
//! how finely it is spent.
//!
//! A run that starts work over `budget` bytes still runs it, one job at a time.
//! Refusing an oversized file would leave a mod permanently unrepairable for
//! being large, which is the opposite of what the budget is for.
