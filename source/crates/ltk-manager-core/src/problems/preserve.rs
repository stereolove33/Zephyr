//! Keeping the names a repair is about to hash away.
//!
//! A `File` property holds the XXH64 of a path and not the path. Once a fix
//! has written the hash the string is gone from the bin, and nothing can
//! derive it back - which is why a repair writes every path it hashes into the
//! project's own `hashes/` table first, under [`Category::Game`]. The mod then
//! carries what it needs to be read, which is what a repair promises in place
//! of reversibility.
//!
//! A name the community tables already resolve is not embedded. It costs size
//! and buys nothing: the reader that would consult the mod's table can already
//! answer from its own.
