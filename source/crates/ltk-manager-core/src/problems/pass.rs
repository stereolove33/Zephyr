//! The pass: one traversal of a project's files for every rule.
//!
//! A rule declares what it reads in [`Rule::subscribe`] and opens nothing
//! itself. The pass then makes two rounds under one budget - every bin, then
//! every file a subscription named - reads each file once at the widest shape
//! anyone asked for, parses and walks each bin once with every subscribed
//! visitor riding the one walk, and hands each rule its part at finish.
//!
//! The design is `docs/design/problems-pass.md`. Where this module's shape
//! differs from the spec's sketches, the spec's own rules table has the reason
//! beside the section, and the doc on the item here says what changed.
//!
//! [`Rule::subscribe`]: super::Rule::subscribe
