//! What is wrong with a mod project, and what a machine can repair.
//!
//! A [`Rule`] checks one thing and reports a [`Problem`] for each place it
//! objects to. A problem names a [`Site`] - a layer, a file, and where inside
//! the file - and carries a [`FixPreview`] where the rule can derive a repair.
//! One pass of every rule over one project is a [`Run`].
//!
//! The model here is generic on purpose. A rule is the only thing that knows a
//! format, so there is no shared apply step: "replace a value" means nothing
//! without the format that holds it. What the model owns is the preview and the
//! address, because those are the parts a user reads.
//!
//! A problem is a description and never a plan. It says what is wrong and what
//! a repair would look like, and it does not carry the steps of that repair.
//! The rule derives those again, from the file on disk, when a user applies
//! them - so a file changed between the run and the fix cannot be written
//! wrong, and a fix offered twice applies once.
