//! Which audio files this mod's own bins ask for, and under what names.
//!
//! A bank is asked for by name. A skin's audio properties hold a list of bank
//! units, and each unit carries the paths of the files it needs - the media
//! bank, the events bank and any media package. That list is where a request
//! for a bank comes from, so it is what a removal has to answer to.
//!
//! **It is also the only plaintext copy of a bank's own name.** An unpacked
//! chunk is named by the hash of its path, and a name is what `audio/bank-id`
//! has to hash to derive an id, so the path a unit names is what resolves that
//! hash back. A bank no unit names is one the game never loads.
//!
//! The class rather than the class that holds it, because six classes hold bank
//! units and they all ask the same way.
//!
//! A [`Fact`]: its collector rides the pass's one walk of every bin, for
//! whichever rules demand it, and a repair computes it on its own through
//! `ProjectFiles::fact`.
