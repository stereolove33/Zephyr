//! A fantome archive's files, read for the rules without unpacking it.
//!
//! A packed WAD is read chunk by chunk from the archive, and a WAD stored as a
//! directory of entries is read entry by entry. Nothing is written to disk.
//!
//! Each read opens the archive again instead of sharing one handle. Bins are
//! read on a pool - see [`Budget::map`](crate::problems::Budget::map) - and a
//! zip entry borrows its archive mutably, so a shared handle would serialize the
//! pool. Reopening a stored entry reads the archive's entry table and the WAD's,
//! which is a few kilobytes.
//!
//! A deflated entry is the exception, and the reason [`ArchiveFiles`] holds
//! bytes. Deflate has no random access, so reading one chunk inflates the whole
//! entry, and reopening would repeat that for every bin. The scan inflates such
//! a WAD once and keeps it for the run.
//! [`normalize_archive`](ltk_fantome::normalize_archive) stores an archive's
//! WADs uncompressed, which avoids this.
