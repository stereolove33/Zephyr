//! Launching League, and following the session that comes of it.
//!
//! The work lives in [`ritoclient`], which knows nothing about this crate - no
//! [`Config`], no [`EventSink`], no error enum of ours. This module is the seam:
//! it unpacks the config, wraps the sink, and owns the types that cross the IPC
//! boundary (see `types`) so the frontend never depends on a crate it cannot
//! see a rename in.
//!
//! [`LeagueLauncher`] is what the shell holds. A [`ritoclient::Launcher`] is
//! meant to be built once and kept - its progress observer is a
//! construction-time property - and the two watchers it starts have to outlive
//! the command that started them, so one lives in app state rather than being
//! rebuilt per call.
