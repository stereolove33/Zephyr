//! Writing chunks of the installed game's archives out to a folder on disk.
//!
//! The browser's second output, beside a copy into a layer. It reads the same
//! rows the tree shows - a file, a directory, a whole archive - expands them
//! into chunk hashes, groups those by the archive that holds them, and drives
//! [`ltk_wad::WadExtractor`] once per archive.
//!
//! The naming rules, the skip-or-replace policy and the parallel decompress
//! belong to `ltk_wad`. What lives here is everything the crate has no way to
//! know: which chunks a directory row stands for, which archive each one comes
//! out of, that the destination must not be inside the League install, and how
//! to report progress to a UI without one event per chunk.
