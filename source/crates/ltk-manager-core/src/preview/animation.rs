//! One `.anm` baked into the pose table a viewport samples.
//!
//! `ltk_anim` evaluates the clip once per frame at the clip's own rate and the viewport
//! interpolates between two frames, so a pose is a function of time and a seek is a
//! sample, per decision 2.6 of docs/plans/vfx-particle-renderer.md.
//!
//! A compressed clip's opening keys come out wrong until `ltk_anim` reads its jump caches,
//! LeagueToolkit/league-toolkit#235.
//!
//! # The buffer
//!
//! Little-endian throughout, with no padding between blocks.
//!
//! ```text
//! magic       u32   0x414B544C, `LTKA`
//! version     u32   1
//! fps         f32
//! frameCount  u32
//! jointCount  u32
//! jointHashes u32 * jointCount
//! poses       f32 * frameCount * jointCount * 10
//! ```
//!
//! Frame `i` is the clip at `i / fps` seconds, and the last frame is its end. A frame
//! holds one pose per joint in `jointHashes` order: translation, the rotation as
//! `x y z w`, then scale, each in the joint's parent space. A joint hash is what the
//! skeleton buffer keys a joint by.
