//! Directory names for installed mods.

//! A mod's identity is its UUID. [`ModSlug`] is only what its directory is
//! called, derived from the project `name` so that browsing `mods/` and
//! revealing a mod in the file manager both land somewhere legible. It is
//! assigned once at install and never re-derived, so renaming a mod in the app
//! leaves the directory where every other tool already found it.
