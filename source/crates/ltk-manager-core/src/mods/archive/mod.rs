//! Mod archives: getting them in, reading what's inside, taking them out.
//!
//! A mod arrives as a single `.modpkg` or `.fantome` file. [`install`] copies it
//! into storage and has [`metadata`] extract a `mod.config.json` beside it, so
//! the library view never has to mount every archive just to render a list.
//! [`migration`] brings in a whole cslol-manager directory at once, and
//! [`storage`] switches an installed mod between reading its archive and reading
//! an unpacked tree.
//! [`documents`] reads the readme and the license a reader asks to see.
