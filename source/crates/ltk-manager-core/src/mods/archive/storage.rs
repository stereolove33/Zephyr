//! Switching one mod between its archive and an unpacked project.
//!
//! ADR-0003 left both storage modes live at once, and ADR-0007 made the
//! archive the install default. This is the switch between them, per mod,
//! after the fact.
//!
//! Unpacking consumes the archive —
//! [`ProjectImporter`](ltk_mod_project::ProjectImporter) writes a fresh project
//! into staging, the user's own metadata is carried across, the two directories
//! swap, and the archive is deleted: the tree carries everything it did, and
//! keeping both would double the mod on disk. Repacking is the way back —
//! [`ProjectPacker`](ltk_mod_project::ProjectPacker) packs the tree into a
//! fresh archive, the same way a repair of an `archive` mod does, and the
//! `content/` tree goes. What the fantome format can carry back is the pack
//! format's contract, not decided here.
//!
//! Exactly one of the two — the tree or the archive — is the mod at any
//! moment, so neither direction needs the other's leftovers to exist.
