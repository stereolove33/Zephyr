//! Repairing an archive-storage fantome in place.
//!
//! A mod stored as its archive has no tree the Problems engine can write to,
//! so a repair reads the archive where it lies, as the check does, holds every
//! fix the rules derive, and edits what changed back into the archive. The
//! library keeps reading the same path, and the mod stays in Archive storage
//! throughout. An archive the edit refuses goes the long way round instead:
//! unpacked into staging, fixed there, and repacked whole - ADR-0025.
//! Replacing the archive, and keeping no copy of the original, is ADR-0005.
