//! Mod health: what a check concluded about one library mod.
//!
//! The Problems engine speaks to a modder, in findings addressed to a property
//! inside a file. A mod user gets the same rules summarized to a verdict, per
//! "The verdict" in docs/ux/MOD_HEALTH.md. Verdicts are remembered in
//! `mod-health-verdicts.json` beside the library index, so the library view can
//! badge every mod without re-scanning any.
