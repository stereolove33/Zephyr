//! The mod library: what is installed, how it is organized, and how it reaches
//! the overlay.
//!
//! [`ModLibrary`] is the entry point. It holds no mod data, which lives in
//! `library.json` on disk. It holds the shared handles (event sink, WAD report
//! cache, linked-bin state) and serializes access to that file. The modules:
//!
//! | Module             | Concern                                           |
//! | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
//! | `index`            | `library.json`: shape, versioning, reconciliation  |
//! | `archive`          | Mod archives in, out, and read                     |
//! | `fantome_layer`    | The content directory a fantome layer unpacks into |
//! | `analysis`         | What a mod touches and what that makes it          |
//! | `health`           | The Problems rules over an installed mod           |
//! | `organize`         | Folders and profiles                               |
//! | `types`            | The shapes the frontend sees                       |
//! | `library`          | Library reads and per-profile mod state            |
//! | `overlay_content`  | Turning library entries into overlay inputs        |
//! | `slug`             | A mod's directory name                             |
//! | `long_paths`       | The 260-character path limit during unpacking      |
//!
//! Every installed mod is a directory under `<storage>/mods/`, named by its
//! slug. `docs/adr/0001-fantome-unpacks-modpkg-stays-packed.md` describes its
//! contents and why a modpkg's differ from a fantome's.
