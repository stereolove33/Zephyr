//! Transient record of linked-bin offenders from the most recent overlay build.
//!
//! Unlike [`crate::mods::WadReportState`], offender status is **not** a stable
//! per-mod property: whether a mod's linked bins resolve depends on the entire
//! enabled set in a given build (another enabled mod can supply the dependency).
//! So this is deliberately in-memory only and replaced wholesale on every build —
//! persisting it across restarts could surface warnings that no longer hold.
