//! The 260-character path limit, as it applies to unpacking a mod.
//!
//! A mod project spends its whole life as a directory tree, so the paths inside
//! it are far longer than the archive that used to hold them. On a Windows with
//! long paths disabled, that tree is one the user's own file manager and every
//! third-party tool can no longer open — Rust's std reaches it through verbatim
//! paths, so the manager itself would keep working while everything around it
//! stopped. The import is refused instead, pointing at the fix.
//!
//! Refusing it takes two passes, because the cheap one cannot be exact. A
//! preflight reads the archive's own answer for where its entries land and
//! stops an import before it spends minutes unpacking, but a Fantome archive
//! stores a packed WAD as one entry and what a resolver will name the chunks
//! inside it is not knowable without unpacking it. So the tree is measured
//! again once it exists, which is the only answer that can be trusted.
//!
//! Both passes measure a path where it will live rather than where it is
//! written. An unpack stages its tree under a uuid and renames it onto the
//! mod's own directory afterwards, so the staging path answers for a mod that
//! never has it.
