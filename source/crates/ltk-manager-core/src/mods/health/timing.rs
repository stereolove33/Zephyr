//! Timing a health pass over the real library, for the dev console.
//!
//! Debug builds only. The numbers a repair is tuned against come from a real
//! library on a real disk, and a synthetic fixture is the one thing that cannot
//! produce them - a 25MB mod of actual bins is what the budget and the pools
//! were sized against.
//!
//! The per-file split rides on `TRACE` and the per-mod line on `DEBUG`, both of
//! which the dev console already streams. What this adds is the trigger and the
//! table, which is the part a reader compares between two builds.
