# Domain glossary

The words this codebase uses for its own concepts, and the ones it deliberately does not. Coding
conventions live in the per-directory `AGENTS.md` files. Decisions live in `docs/adr/`.

## The library

**Mod library** — everything a user has installed, under one **storage directory** (`modStoragePath`
in settings, the app data directory by default). Distinct from the **Creator Workshop**, where a
user authors mods rather than installs them.

**Library index** — `<storage>/library.json`, the single document holding every mod entry, profile
and folder. Every read and write goes through the index lock, because each write rewrites the whole
file.

**Mod entry** — one row of the index: an id, an installed-at timestamp, the format it arrived as,
where its content is stored, and its slug once the layout migration has assigned one. It is the
only record of which mod is which — see ADR-0002.

**Drop folder** — `<storage>/archives/`. Somewhere a user can drop a `.fantome` or `.modpkg` and
have it installed on the next reconcile. Since the layout migration it is _only_ that: installed
archives no longer live there.

## A mod on disk

**Mod project** — the on-disk layout a mod is stored in: `mod.config.json` plus a `content/<layer>/`
tree. The same layout the Creator Workshop authors in, and the one `ltk_overlay`'s `FsModContent`
reads. A fantome the user unpacked is one. A modpkg is not, and neither is a mod as an install
leaves it — see ADR-0001, ADR-0003 and ADR-0007.

**Import** — turning a packaged mod into a mod project directory, whatever it arrived as. One driver
serves every surface, `ltk_mod_project`'s `ProjectImporter`: it owns the output directory, a
directory for every layer the config declares and the config write, leaving a per-format backend to
decode. `FantomeImporter` and `ModpkgImporter` are those backends, so the library's unpack path
and the Creator Workshop's two import dialogs are three call sites over one implementation. `RAW/` routing, case-insensitive `WAD/` matching and reading past a bad CRC32 live
inside the fantome backend, so a second importer beside it is a second copy of those bugs — the
workshop had one per format until they were collapsed onto this.

**Ritobin** — our own text syntax for a `.bin`, and the format the manager opens one in for
editing. A ritobin file is source rather than content: the game reads only the compiled form, so a
ritobin file packaged into a shipped mod is build residue the author left in.

**Slug** — a mod's directory name under `<storage>/mods/`, derived from the project's `name` (never
its `display_name`), assigned once at install and never re-derived. **Id** is the mod's identity, a
UUID, and it is what profiles, folders and reports refer to. Two mods can want the same slug; the
second gets a numeric suffix.

**Preserve** — the import step that reads the names a fantome's own files still hold and embeds
the ones the community hashtables cannot recover into the archive copy, per the Embedded
Hashtables standard. The **harvest** is what that step found, recorded on the entry as
`HarvestSummary`: how many names the archive gained, and how many chunks arrived with no
recoverable name at all (`unharvestable` — what tells a mod that preserved cleanly from one that
was already lossy).

**Mod archive** — `mods/<slug>.fantome` or `mods/<slug>.modpkg`, the file the mod arrived as,
beside its directory. For a mod stored `archive` it is the mod — the content provider reads from
it. An unpack consumes it and a repack packs the tree into a fresh one (ADR-0007), so exactly one
of tree or archive is the mod at any moment. A fantome's copy is made through the preserve, so
names the community tables cannot recover ride in the archive itself.

**Storage** — where a mod's content is: `project` for the unpacked tree, `archive` for a mod read
out of the file beside it. Recorded on the entry rather than derived. Every install lands as
`archive` (ADR-0007), and `project` is what an unpack from the card, or a discovered project
directory, records.

**Unpack** and **repack** — moving one mod between the two storage modes, from its card in the
library. Unpack reads the archive and deletes it, repack packs the tree into a fresh archive and
deletes the tree (ADR-0007). Neither is offered for a modpkg, which has no unpacked form. See
ADR-0004.

**Staging directory** — `mods/.staging-<uuid>/`, where an install or a conversion assembles a mod
before it is renamed into place, with `mods/.staging-<uuid>.<ext>` beside it for the archive copy.
Swept at startup, and only there: staging runs outside the index lock, so a sweep at any other
moment could delete a directory an install is still filling.

**Legacy layout** — `mods/<uuid>/` plus `archives/<uuid>.<ext>`, the shape a pre-slug library
stored a mod in. A transient state, not a kind of mod: everything core does — overlay builds
included — reads it, while conveniences such as unpack and repack wait for the slug. The layout
migration drains it, retrying whatever it could not move every launch. See ADR-0008.

## Mod health

**Check** — one pass of the Problems rules over an installed mod's content, summarized for a mod
user. It reads and never writes, and it reads a mod where it lies: an `archive`-storage mod is
scanned inside its archive rather than unpacked to be looked at. A modder's view of the same rules
is the Problems panel, and the split is deliberate — see `docs/ux/MOD_HEALTH.md`. A check requires
the **hashtable cache** and does not run without it — see ADR-0009.

**Pass** — the engine's one traversal of a project's files during a check. A rule **subscribes**
to what it reads and opens nothing itself: the pass reads each file once, parses and walks each
bin once with every subscribed visitor riding the one walk, and hands each rule its part at
finish. What more than one rule reads off the bins is a **fact**, computed once per pass and
owned by no rule. The vocabulary in full is `docs/design/problems-pass.md` section 2, and the
decision is ADR-0013.

**Verdict** — what a check concluded: `healthy`, `repairable`, or `unrepairable`, with the counts
behind it. Remembered per mod in `mod-health-verdicts.json` beside the index. A cache of a
computation, not a record — a lost file refills on the next check. There is no fourth word: a mod
the manager could not judge is **unchecked** instead.

The three words say what a **repair** can do, and nothing about how badly the mod is hurt.
`unrepairable` covers both a mod the game will refuse to load and one that plays with an effect
missing, because neither carries a fix. Severity is the other axis, it rides in the counts, and a
surface that draws a verdict reads both.

**Rung** — the two axes folded into the one thing a surface draws: `repairable`, `broken` or
`flagged`. The hue is the severity's and the words stay the verdict's, so `broken` is a mod the
game refuses and `flagged` is one that loads with a fault no repair reaches. It is not a fourth
verdict word and nothing stores it — every surface derives it from the verdict and the counts
already on the row. Over several mods a repair on offer leads, and below that the loudest wins. See
"How loud a finding is drawn" in `docs/ux/MOD_HEALTH.md`.

**Announcement** — the one unprompted thing mod health says about the library it just read: the
drawer for a **rung** the game pays for, an info toast for one it does not. Spent against the
findings rather than against the launch, so a library that has not moved since the reader met it
says nothing at all and leaves the news to the status bar cell. What is compared is each unhealthy
mod and its counts, which is why re-ordering the library is not a change. There is no dismiss —
meeting it is what spends it.

**Unchecked** — a mod carrying no verdict, which draws no badge and says nothing. Never checked,
checked by a build whose stored shape has since been discarded, or declined because the hashtable
cache was empty. A verdict is a claim, and an unchecked mod is a claim about nothing — the state
ADR-0009 chose over a fourth verdict word.

**Dormant** — a rule that ran, found everything it finds, and claims none of it, because
something it needs is not on this machine. Two states put a rule to sleep: an installed game older
than the patch the rule describes, and no installed game to read at all. Either way its findings
draw dimmed and count towards nothing, so a **verdict** is a claim only about the rules that were
awake. Not **unchecked**, which is the whole mod saying nothing.

**Basis** — what a check was a claim about: the installed game build, the manager version the rules
and their tables shipped in, and the **generation** of the hashtable cache and the **meta schema**
the run read. Recorded on every verdict, and comparing it is how the health sweep decides which
verdicts are stale.

**Hashtable cache** — the shared mimir cache of community hashtables, one per machine rather than
per library, which is how a WAD chunk and a bin's hashed properties get their names back. Its
**generation** is the manifest stamp, which moves only when a sync installs a table, so a press
that changes nothing makes no verdict stale. Filled by **Sync now** in Settings and by the startup
sync that runs in front of the health sweep.

**Meta schema** — what type the game expects every bin property to hold, per build, published as
one database by the LTK Meta Wiki. The game compares a bin's type tag against its own registrar by
exact equality and silently discards a value that does not match, so this is the whole of what a
type check needs. The cached copy beside the hashtables is the one a check reads, and the **health
sweep** refreshes it before it runs, so a newer schema reaches a user without waiting on a release.
A build ships a snapshot as the floor under that, for the machine that has never synced or is
offline, and its **generation** is the publisher's stamp. Which way round those two go is the point:
the sync is how the schema is delivered and the snapshot is only what stands in until it lands, so a
publisher that cannot be reached costs a check its freshness and never its result. Not the **schema
migration**, which is `library.json`'s own versioning and unrelated.

**Health sweep** — a pass that re-checks a set of mods and forgets the verdicts of mods the
library no longer holds. Its **scope** is what a caller chooses: the startup pass and the one a
hashtable sync starts take every mod whose basis moved, and a press in the library takes every mod
or the reader's selection, whatever their basis says. It forgets either way and checks only with
the hashtable cache in hand — the automatic scope stands down without it, and a pressed one refuses
in words, because that one has somebody waiting. Not the **staging sweep**, which is the same word
for clearing `mods/.staging-*` and is unrelated.

**Repair** — applying every fix the live rules derive for one mod. In the tree for a `project`
mod. For an `archive` mod: fix what the check read where it lies, and edit the fixed files back
into the archive, so a repair costs what changed rather than everything the mod holds — see
ADR-0025. An archive that cannot be edited is unpacked, fixed and repacked whole instead, which is
the same outcome by a slower road — see ADR-0005.
Neither is reversible. Neither destroys a **name**, which is what preserved names guarantee, but a
repair may lose fidelity where the defect admits no in-place correction — see ADR-0011.
**Repair all** is the banner's one press over every repairable mod at once, and nothing is ever
repaired without it. Not every defect is a repair's to fix: where the correction needs content only
the installed game has, the overlay **merge**s at build time and the mod is left as it is — see
ADR-0012.

**Compensated** — a defect the overlay **merge** corrects while it builds, so the mod on disk
keeps it forever and the game never sees it. Not **repaired**: nothing is written, no press exists,
and the mod carries the defect again under any other manager. Not healthy either, because the mod
really is defective. So a rule offering no fix is now two different statements — nothing can correct
this, and a repair is the wrong instrument for this — and no **verdict** word tells them apart.

**Preserved names** — the paths a repair writes into the mod's own `hashes/game.hashes.txt`
before it hashes them into `File` properties, so the mod still names what it holds. Additive and
idempotent, and it excludes what the community hashtables already resolve. It is what replaced
the restore point and Undo — see ADR-0006. Not the same as the **harvest** at import, which
recovers names off an incoming archive rather than keeping ones a write is about to destroy.

## The four migrations

Four different things, and the words do not overlap:

**Layout migration** — the startup pass that moves every mod off the uuid layout and onto its slug.
Two renames per mod and no unpack (ADR-0003), so it runs unasked, ahead of the first reconcile. A
toast reports it while it runs, and a dialog lists whatever it could not move — which stays in the
legacy layout, keeps working, and is tried again next launch (ADR-0008).

**Schema migration** — versioning of `library.json` itself (`v0 → v1 → v2`). Runs on load, backs the
old file up first, and never touches anything on disk outside that one document.

**Cslol import** — bringing in mods from a cslol-manager installation. An _import_, not a migration,
whatever the surrounding code is still called.

**Migration table** — one JSONL file per game build, shipped in the core crate, naming the bin
properties Riot retyped at that build and how a value crosses. What `bin/property-type` reads for
a build later than the one installed, and wherever the **meta schema** does not reach. Riot
migrating its own format, not a migration of anything the manager owns.

## The overlay

**Content provider** — how the overlay builder reads a mod's files, chosen by the mod's **storage**
and never by its provenance: an unpacked mod project through `FsModContent`, a modpkg through
`ModpkgContent`, and a fantome whose content is still inside its archive through `FantomeContent`.
A mod entry's `format` records where it came from and only picks between the two packed readers.

**Layer** — a named slice of a mod's content that a profile can turn on independently. `base` is
always on. Not what a **merge** does to a chunk, which is a different relationship with the same
everyday word.

**Merge** — building a mod's chunk over the game's copy of it rather than in place of it, so the
game's content survives wherever the mod says nothing. A value replaces, a map combines key by key,
and an object combines field by field. It happens while the overlay is built and is never written
into the mod, so it is not a **repair** and costs the mod nothing — see ADR-0012.
_Avoid_: layer, patch, override

**Declaration** — one property edit a layer's `game_data.yaml` carries: an entry, a property path
and a value, applied over the game's copy of every chunk declaring the entry while the overlay is
built. The mod names the key it changes and ships no copy of the chunk. A game bin opened inside a
project writes its edits as declarations — see ADR-0042. Not a **merge**, which reads a whole chunk
the mod ships.
_Avoid_: patch, override

**Module** — one item of a layer's `game_data.yaml` list of modules: an `entries` map of
declarations by entry, or a `target` chunk with its edits, applied in list order. It may carry a
`name`, which changes nothing about how it applies, and an `entries` module may hold no entry yet.
A declared document writes its new keys to the module the reader chose, else to the last one
naming the entry — see ADR-0048 and ADR-0054.
_Avoid_: group, section

**Game-copy reference** — a declaration's value spelled `!ref <entry>:<path>`, read from the game's
copy of that entry at every build instead of copied into the mod. Not what Find references lists,
which is the places a bin names an object, class or file.

**Built-in mod** — a mod project the manager generates from the installed game and the other
mods when a setting turns it on, under `<storage>/builtin/<slug>`. It is injected above workshop
projects and every enabled mod, belongs to no profile, and never enters the library. Default ward
skins, base skins, map skins and map decorations are the four. See ADR-0043, ADR-0052 and ADR-0053.
_Avoid_: tweak, preset

**Profile** — a named set of enabled mods, their order, and their per-mod layer states. The active
profile is what the overlay is built from.

**Mount error** — why the game refused an archive it was mounting. There are four, and the manager
takes the game's word for each rather than coining its own, so a health finding and a diagnostics
code name one state:

- **Missing** — the archive was not where the game looked for it.
- **Unable to open** — the archive was there, and the game could not open it.
- **Corrupt** — the archive opened, and its own contents do not hold together.
- **Inconsistent** — two archives the game mounted disagree about the bytes behind one path.

**Inconsistent** is the one an overlay could create, because routing can put a single path into
several archives. It crashes the game and flags the install for repair, though that repair finds
nothing to fix, because an overlay leaves the game's own files untouched. No rule carries the name:
the build routes every copy of a path by that path's own hash and fans a shared chunk out to all of
its holders, so the state is one the build prevents rather than one a check finds. **Corrupt**
names no rule either, and for the same reason: each of the three defects that would have sat under
it was measured at zero, and each is a state the build should assert over the archives it just
wrote rather than one a pass over a library should hunt for. So the naming rule now has no
instance, which does not make it wrong — see ADR-0010.

## The Creator Workshop

**Sandbox** - the data source a workshop editor reads from and writes to: the installed game
alone, or a mod project's layers stacked over the game in the overlay's order. A document opens in
a sandbox. The sandbox decides which copy of a path the build uses, and whether an edit writes a
layer file or a **declaration** for a game bin that no layer ships. A project sandbox shows the
project's own build output, without other mods. The word comes from Riot's own editor, and the
object tab's header shows it - see ADR-0056. Not a **layer**, which is one part of a sandbox's
stack, and not a **profile**, which is what the overlay builds from.
_Avoid_: environment, workspace, baseline

**VFX template** - a stored emitter or particle system an author starts a new effect from, kept
in the core crate's catalog as clipboard text beside its rig. An emitter template lands in a
system, and a system template lands its emitters in one or creates a new system. See ADR-0058.
_Avoid_: preset, which names a **Built-in mod**, and starter

**Rig** - how the preview carries a particle system, which the file does not say: a **carrier**
and a **playback**, and where the choice came from. The rig picks itself from the context a system
was opened from, a template, or the system alone, until the author changes it. See ADR-0057.

**Carrier** - the half of a rig that places the system's origin: Ground, Bone, Flight or Orbit.
A word for the code and the docs, and the UI shows the kind names alone.

**Playback** - the half of a rig that says when a run starts over: Once, Replay or Continuous.

## Settings

**Setting id** — one setting's name everywhere: its key in `settings.json`, what a link calls it,
and what `Copy ID` copies. Dot-separated and naming a **domain** rather than the tab it draws on:
`launch.mode`, `appearance.theme`. Stable, and never silently changed: a rename or a removal leaves
a **retired id** behind, the old id with the release it stopped in and what replaced it or why it
is gone — see ADR-0024. The eleven settings a frontend store owns keep a store key of their own
beside the id.

**UI path** — what a link calls one _place_ in settings, slash-separated and naming a position on
the page: `general`, `general/league`, `general/league/launching`. It moves when the page does, so a
link to one falls back to its parent when the place is gone. A separate space from the setting id,
with a separate promise — see ADR-0023.

**Node** — anything a link can name: a setting by its id, or a tab, a card or a group by its UI
path. A card titled as its tab shares the tab's node.

**Card** and **group** — the two levels between a tab and a row. A card is a subject, drawn as a
heading on the page ground with a panel under it. A group is a facet of that subject, drawn as an
uppercase label over a band of rows. Neither is a **section**, which the codebase uses for the
`*Section.tsx` component holding a whole tab's cards. See `docs/ux/SETTINGS.md`.

## User-facing copy

**Message** — one string a user reads, as a key in `messages/en/<module>.json` and the typed
function Paraglide compiles from it. A key is a slot, `library_empty_title`, or the domain id the
backend sends, `rule.bin/property-type.title`. The frontend owns every message and the backend sends
codes, ids and typed fields — see ADR-0017.

**Catalog** — `messages/` as a whole, every message the app can say, one file per module and
`common.json` for the words every module shares. Its compiled form under `src/paraglide/` is
generated and not committed — see ADR-0018.

**Error copy** — what the frontend shows for one backend error: a **title** naming what went
wrong, a **description** giving the remedy where one exists, and a **detail** carrying prose from
outside the app, such as an OS or crate error, drawn as data. A **describer** in `src/i18n/`
turns an error's code and fields into that copy, and nothing else reads an error's fields for
display.

## Home

**Home** — the page the manager opens on, at `/`, per `docs/ux/HOME.md`. It answers whether
pressing Play is safe, what changed in the manager, and what the project has to say. The library
is **Mods**, at `/mods`.

**Status line** — Home's one sentence about the library and its one action, derived and never
stored. The first row that holds wins, and its hue follows mod health's rungs.

**Notice** — one line the project publishes that has to be seen, drawn as a banner under the
status line until it is dismissed or expires. Its source is `news/notices.json` on the default
branch, read raw, so a notice is a reviewed change. A `versions` range keeps it to the builds it
concerns.

**Announcement** — a post in the Announcements category of the repository's Discussions, read
from the category's Atom feed and listed as news on Home. A title, a date and a link, and nothing
the app translates: feed text is drawn as data.

## The viewport

**Hexshade** — the system that draws a mesh with the game's own shaders: `crates/hexshade` in the
backend and `src/modules/viewport/hexshade/` in the frontend, per `docs/plans/shader-pipeline.md`.
It translates, it does not port: a shipped DXBC blob becomes GLSL ES 3.00 and a **sidecar** of
the names a renderer binds it by. Reading a material's passes is not part of it. That stays with
the material read in core and the game crate.

**Program** — one shader's vertex and pixel stage for one **define list**, the permutation the
game's shader cache holds for it. A pass without one is drawn as the error material, never as a
guess.

**Translation cache** — `<app data>/shaders/v<PIPELINE_VERSION>/`, each translated blob keyed by
its hash, so a permutation costs its translation once per machine.
