//! Patcher state owned by the Tauri shell.
//!
//! The session thread, its lifecycle state and the line protocol all live in the
//! Tauri-free core crate; what stays here is the managed-state wrappers Tauri
//! registers and the [`thread`] adapter that maps core notifications to UI
//! events.
//!
//! The legacy in-process implementation (`api.rs` / `runner.rs`, which loaded
//! the patcher DLL into the manager process and interfered with Vanguard) was
//! deleted here; it was superseded by the external host in `c0ecc27` and is
//! recoverable from history if the native reimplementation ever wants it.
