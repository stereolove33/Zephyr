## Overview

LTK Manager is a desktop application for managing League of Legends mods built on the `.modpkg` format. It serves as the graphical counterpart to the `league-mod` CLI tool, making mod management accessible to users who prefer visual interfaces.

### Goals

| Goal              | Description                                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Accessibility** | Make mod management approachable for non-technical users |
| **Type Safety**   | Leverage Rust and TypeScript for compile-time guarantees |
| **Performance**   | Fast startup, minimal memory footprint, responsive UI    |
| **Integration**   | Seamlessly work with the LeagueToolkit ecosystem         |

### Tech Stack

| Layer    | Technology      | Purpose                                     |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Runtime  | Tauri v2        | Native desktop application framework        |
| Backend  | Rust            | Core logic, file operations, mod processing |
| Frontend | React 19        | User interface                              |
| Routing  | TanStack Router | Type-safe navigation                        |
| Styling  | Tailwind CSS v4 | Visual design system                        |
| State    | Zustand         | Client-side state management                |

---

## Architecture

The application follows a two-layer architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Frontend Layer (WebView)

The frontend is responsible for:

- Rendering the user interface
- Handling user interactions
- Managing client-side UI state
- Communicating with the backend via IPC

### Backend Layer (Rust)

The backend is responsible for:

- File system operations (reading/writing mods)
- Mod package processing (using `ltk_modpkg` library)
- Project configuration (using `ltk_mod_project` library)
- Settings persistence
- League of Legends installation detection

### Communication

Frontend and backend communicate through Tauri's IPC (Inter-Process Communication) system. The frontend invokes commands on the backend, which processes them and returns results. All data is serialized as JSON during transit.

### 6. Home

The page the app opens on. The full spec is in [docs/ux/HOME.md](docs/ux/HOME.md).

**Frame**: the library page's own. A toolbar with Import and Play at its trailing edge, notices and
the status line above it, then the library's inset region, scrolling.

**Cards**, in the mod and project cards' frame:

- What's new, in the wide column: a digest of the newest release, where every release's notes expand in place
- Your library: the active profile, enabled of total, the health marker, and Open Mods
- Last game
- News and Learn, with Runeforge and the Runeforge Wiki among the Learn links

**Artwork**: Home shows none for now. The Runeforge assets in `src/assets/runeforge-*.webp` are no longer imported by Home.

## Security Model

### Permissions

The application requests only necessary permissions:

| Permission           | Purpose                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |

| Dialog               | File picker and folder selection               |
| Shell (Limited)      | Open URLs in browser, open folders in explorer |

### Content Security

- WebView content is loaded from local files only
- No arbitrary code execution from mod files
- Settings and mod index stored in app data directory

### Mod Safety

- Mods are sandboxed within the mod storage directory
- Projects are sandboxed within the Workshop directory
- Digital signatures can verify mod authenticity (when signed)
- No automatic execution of mod contents
