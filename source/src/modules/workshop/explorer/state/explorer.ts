 * store gives: the first preview a row opens splits a group off beside it, and
 * a leaf that gains a split around it remounts everything under it. A document
 * holding its own location would land back at the root on the very double click
 * that opened the file.
 *
 * Nothing here is persisted. A filter answers one question and is gone by the
