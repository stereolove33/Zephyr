# Development Guide

This guide covers how to build LTK Manager from source and contribute to the project.

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable toolchain)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 22+
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- Platform-specific dependencies (see below)

### Linux

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev
```

### Windows / macOS

No additional system dependencies required beyond Rust and Node.js.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeagueToolkit/ltk-manager.git
cd ltk-manager
pnpm install
```

### Development Mode

```bash
# Full dev mode — Rust backend + React frontend with hot reload
pnpm tauri dev

# Frontend only — skips the Rust rebuild, faster for UI iteration
pnpm dev
```

### Verbose Backend Logging

```bash
RUST_LOG=ltk_manager=trace,tauri=info pnpm tauri dev
```

## Code Quality

```bash
pnpm typecheck        # TypeScript type checking
pnpm lint             # ESLint
pnpm format           # Prettier (auto-fix)
pnpm check            # All three (typecheck + lint + format:check)

# Rust
cargo clippy -p ltk-manager
cargo fmt -p ltk-manager
```

## Generated Files

Three artefacts are checked in and regenerated deliberately rather than at build time.

```bash
pnpm generate:types          # TypeScript bindings for the Tauri commands
pnpm generate:licenses       # public/third-party-licenses.json, needs cargo-about on PATH
pnpm generate:meta-schema    # the embedded meta schema snapshot
```

`generate:licenses` also runs from the pre-commit hook whenever `Cargo.lock` changes.

`generate:meta-schema` goes to the network, so it stays out of the hook. It writes nothing when the
snapshot already matches what the publisher serves, and it takes `--check` and `--force`, both
described in the script's own header. It reads the database out of the meta wiki's own repository
rather than from the API that serves the same bytes, because the API sits behind a bot check a CI
runner cannot pass - see `docs/research/meta-api-reachability-from-ci.md`. The runtime still reads
the API.

The release workflow refreshes the snapshot alongside the licenses manifest, because a snapshot
older than the installed game build stands the `bin/property-type` check down for the offline user
it exists to serve. That user is the one this matters for: the app syncs the schema itself before a
health sweep, so a machine that has synced is already past whatever the snapshot says.

## Production Build

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

Output is written to `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`:

| Platform | Path                                     | Format             |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Windows  | `bundle/nsis/LTK Manager_*-setup.exe`    | NSIS installer     |
| macOS    | `bundle/dmg/LTK Manager_*.dmg`           | DMG disk image     |
| macOS    | `bundle/macos/LTK Manager.app`           | Application bundle |
| Linux    | `bundle/deb/ltk-manager_*.deb`           | Debian package     |
| Linux    | `bundle/appimage/ltk-manager_*.AppImage` | AppImage           |

`bundle.targets` in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` names the NSIS installer alone, per ADR-0039.
To build another format:

```bash
pnpm tauri build --bundles msi    # Windows MSI, which no release ships
pnpm tauri build --bundles dmg    # macOS DMG only
pnpm tauri build --bundles deb    # Linux Debian only
```

For faster unoptimized builds during development:

```bash
pnpm tauri build --debug
```

## Log Files

Logs are written to disk automatically and are useful for debugging:

- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\dev.leaguetoolkit.manager\logs\ltk-manager.log`
- **Linux / macOS:** `~/.local/share/dev.leaguetoolkit.manager/logs/ltk-manager.log`
