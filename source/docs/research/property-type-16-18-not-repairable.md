# `bin/property-type` does not repair the 16.18 String to File retypes

Research note, gathered on 2026-09-12 against `main` at `504d317a` (v1.18.1). Sections 1 to 4 are
the evidence. Section 5 is the proposed fix and section 6 what is deliberately left out.

The question came from users on patch 16.18 reporting that `String` to `File` property types are
not repaired. Two separate defects produce that one complaint, and each accounts for a different
half of it:

- **The shipped meta schema snapshot stops at build `8104348` (patch 16.17).** A 16.18 install is
  past it, so `MetaSchema::describes` is false, the schema arm of the rule stands down entirely
  and the six 16.18 `String` to `File` retypes are never reported at all.
- **`Conversion::between` crosses one dimension of a type at a time.** Two of the 16.18 shapes
  change a tag and an item type together, so they fall to `Conversion::Unknown`, report with no
  repair, and tell the reader to rebuild the mod against the current game.

Both are fixed on this branch, in sections 5.1 and 5.3. Section 5.2 is what keeps the first from
happening again, and it is left as a decision rather than a change.

## 1. What 16.18 changed

`rito-meta diff 16.17 16.18` returns twelve changed properties. Patch 16.18 is content build
`8159717`. Seven of the twelve carry a path across to `File`:

| Class and property                                | Old type           | New type         |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| `TextureResource.texturePath`                     | `String`           | `File`           |
| `AtlasDataBase.mTextureName`                      | `String`           | `File`           |
| `MapBakeProperties.RmaStaticLightGridTexturePath` | `String`           | `File`           |
| `MapClouds.CloudsTexturePath`                     | `String`           | `File`           |
| `MapCubemapProbe.CubemapProbePath`                | `String`           | `File`           |
| `MapTerrainPaint.TerrainPaintTexturePath`         | `String`           | `File`           |
| `EvolutionDescription.mIconNames`                 | `List[String]`     | `List[File]`     |
| `UiElementParticleSystemData.TextureOverrides`    | `Map[File,String]` | `Map[File,File]` |
| `StaticMaterialDef.type`                          | `U32`              | `U8`             |
| `AudioPriorityBehavior.TargetQueue`               | `Link`             | `Hash`           |
| `AudioQueueConfig.0x1c6439cf`                     | `List2[Link]`      | `List2[Hash]`    |
| `AudioQueueConfigList.queues`                     | `List2[Link]`      | `List2[Hash]`    |

`TextureResource.texturePath` is the one behind the reports. It is in nearly every skin mod.

The shipped migration table `problems/tables/binfile_migration_16.17.8087655.jsonl` names none of
these classes except `UiElementParticleSystemData`, so the table arm of the rule cannot answer for
any of them. Everything below is about the schema arm.

## 2. The shipped snapshot is behind the game

`MetaSchema::describes` is `build.content() <= self.latest`, and `Judge::lens` returns `None` for a
build it refuses. `Lens::objection` then asks the schema nothing.

```
node scripts/generate-meta-schema.mjs --check
The snapshot is at 2026-08-24T03:56:00Z, reaching build 8104348, and the publisher is at
2026-08-24T03:56:00Z, reaching build 8159717.
```

Built against the shipped snapshot alone, with `TextureResource.texturePath` holding a string:

```
build 16.17.8104348: schema=true hits=0
build 16.18.8159717: schema=false hits=0
```

Not a finding without a repair. No finding. **A 16.18 install loses every schema-derived finding
the rule has, not only the 16.18 ones,** because one build comparison stands the whole arm down.

Nothing tells the reader this happened. `describes` has one caller outside the schema module, and
no panel draws the gap between the database's reach and the installed build.

### Why the snapshot is behind

`release-prepare.yml` runs `generate-meta-schema.mjs` and commits the result, so the snapshot
tracks the release cadence and nothing else. v1.18.1 was cut on 2026-09-10 and the generator wrote
nothing, so the 16.18 revisions landed in `lol-meta-wiki` after that date. The snapshot has not
moved since it was introduced in `df557df1` on 2026-09-01.

### Why the cache does not always cover for it

`MetaSchemaCache::load` prefers whichever copy covers the installed build, so a synced machine is
fine. The cache is filled in exactly two places:

```
.
|-- mods/health/sweep.rs: fill_meta_schema
|   |-- runs in front of the library health sweep
|-- src-tauri/src/commands/hashtables.rs
    |-- sync_hashtables, the Settings cache card
```

The workshop problems pass fetches nothing. `BinPropertyType::subscribe` calls
`Judge::opened(project.build())`, which reads whatever `meta_schema::shared` already has. A user
who works in the workshop and never runs a library sweep sits on the shipped snapshot forever.

Neither does the snapshot behave as a floor when the cache is also behind. `load` falls back to the
shipped copy only when the shipped copy describes the build, so when neither reaches it the cached
one is parsed and answers nothing.

## 3. `Conversion::between` crosses one dimension at a time

The second defect does not depend on the database being behind. Run against the published database
at build `8159717`, with values shaped the way a pre-16.17 mod writes them:

```
TextureResource.texturePath:                    string -> file             HashValue  fix=true
AtlasDataBase.mTextureName:                     string -> file             HashValue  fix=true
EvolutionDescription.mIconNames as list:        list[string] -> list[file] HashValue  fix=true
EvolutionDescription.mIconNames as list2:       list2[string] -> list[file] Unknown   fix=false
UiElementParticleSystemData as map[hash,string]: map[hash,string] -> map[file,file] Unknown fix=false
UiElementParticleSystemData as map[file,string]: map[file,string] -> map[file,file] HashValue fix=true
```

The two `Unknown` rows report this, from `note`:

> The game reads this property as `list[file]` and drops a value of any other type. Nothing
> rewrites a `list2[string]` into one, so the mod has to be rebuilt against the current game.

That sentence is what a user reads as "unfixable", and it is wrong in both cases. Reading
`Conversion::between`:

- `list2[string]` to `list[file]` misses because the `Container` and `UnorderedContainer` arm
  requires `to.value` to equal `from.value`, and the same-kind arm requires `to.kind` to equal
  `from.kind`. Neither holds when the tag and the item type move together, so it falls through to
  `widening`, which answers `Unknown` for a container.
- `map[hash,string]` to `map[file,file]` misses because one arm requires `from.key == to.key` and
  the other requires `from.value == to.value`. A map whose key and value both move matches neither.

Both are mechanically repairable with code the rule already has. `hashed` converts an
`UnorderedContainer` of `String`, `retagged` swaps the `List` and `List2` tags, and `rehash_keys`
rekeys a `Hash`-keyed map while `hashed` rewrites its `String` values. The gap is that `Conversion`
is one tag and `convert` dispatches on it once, so no row can name two steps.

Fixed in section 5.3. The same six shapes now read:

```
TextureResource.texturePath:                    string -> file              HashValue      fix=true
AtlasDataBase.mTextureName:                     string -> file              HashValue      fix=true
EvolutionDescription.mIconNames as list:        list[string] -> list[file]  HashValue      fix=true
EvolutionDescription.mIconNames as list2:       list2[string] -> list[file] RetagHashValue fix=true
UiElementParticleSystemData as map[hash,string]: map[hash,string] -> map[file,file] HashKeyValue fix=false
UiElementParticleSystemData as map[file,string]: map[file,string] -> map[file,file] HashValue    fix=true
```

The one row still without a repair is the map whose key no table names back to its path, and it now
says why:

> Neither the Mimir hashtables nor the mod's own resolve `0x00000001` back to its path, and only
> those paths cross to File keys, the 64-bit xxHash. Adding the paths to the mod's hashtables makes
> this repairable.

That is the rule's existing sentence for an unresolvable hash, and it names something the reader can
act on. "Rebuild the mod against the current game" did not.

## 4. What each defect costs

| Reader                                 | Before                                               | After 5.1 and 5.3                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 16.18, cache synced since 16.18 landed | Five of seven path retypes repair, two say rebuild   | Every path retype repairs where its hashes resolve |
| 16.18, cache older or absent           | Silence on all twelve, and on every other schema row | The same, off the shipped snapshot                 |
| 16.17 or older                         | Unaffected                                           | Unaffected                                         |

## 5. The fix

Three changes, independent of each other, in the order they pay off. Sections 5.1 and 5.3 are
applied on this branch. Section 5.2 is left for the maintainer, because each of its three pieces is
a decision about the product rather than about this rule.

### 5.1 Refresh the embedded snapshot

`node scripts/generate-meta-schema.mjs` moves the snapshot from `8104348` to `8159717`. The same
two-build check then reads:

```
build 16.17.8104348: schema=true hits=0
build 16.18.8159717: schema=true hits=1
```

`cargo test -p ltk-manager-core` is 1308 passed, 0 failed with the new snapshot. This is the whole
of the first defect for every user, online or off, cache or no cache, and it is one command and one
commit. It is applied on this branch.

### 5.2 Stop the snapshot depending on the release cadence

The snapshot moves when a release is cut, and the game moves when Riot ships a patch. The two have
no reason to line up, and section 2 is what happens when they do not. Three pieces, smallest first:

```
.
|-- A scheduled workflow running `generate-meta-schema.mjs --check`
|   |-- opens a PR with the regenerated snapshot when the check fails
|   |-- the release then commits a snapshot that is already current
|-- Sync the schema in front of a project problems pass
|   |-- `fill_meta_schema` is what the library sweep already calls
|   |-- the workshop reader is the one this defect was reported by
|-- Say so when the game has outrun the database
    |-- `MetaSchema::describes` is false and nothing draws it
    |-- the rule reporting nothing reads as a clean project, which is the worst of the answers
```

The third is the one to keep even if the other two land. A check that stands down silently cannot
be told from a check that passed.

An alternative to the third, worth weighing rather than assuming: have `Judge::lens` floor to the
newest build the database names instead of refusing, the way `class_schema` already does. It would
keep the schema arm alive on a build past the database, at the cost of claiming a type the
installed game may have moved since. Recommended only beside a visible note that the answer is
floored, because silently answering at an older build is how a rule reports a mismatch that is not
there.

### 5.3 Name the two roads that cross both halves of a type

A list's ordering tag and its item type are independent, and so are a map's keys and its values.
Two variants say so, beside the seven roads `Conversion` already names:

```rust
/// A container's items go the way `HashValue` does, and its ordering tag flips.
RetagHashValue,
/// A `Map`'s keys go the way `HashKey` does, and its values the way `HashValue` does.
HashKeyValue,
```

`Conversion::between` answers `RetagHashValue` where the tag flips over items that cross, and
`HashKeyValue` where a map's keys are `Hash` to `File` and its values cross as well. Each is two
calls the rule already had - `hash_value` then `retag`, and `rehash_keys` then `hash_value` - so no
conversion machinery is new.

A recursive `Then(&'static Conversion, &'static Conversion)` was the first shape considered and
rejected. `Conversion::between` computes its steps, and a computed step has no `'static` to borrow
from, so the general form would cost a `Box` and `Conversion`'s `Copy` with it. Two named roads are
what the pairs actually are, and the file already reads as an enumeration of concrete roads.

What the two keep:

- **Both halves or neither.** `crossing` takes a copy, runs both steps and commits only when both
  report a change. A value left between the two types declares neither, and the four-row
  idempotence in the module header is what a half-applied repair would break.
- **`keep_names` sees every path the road hashes away.** `HashKeyValue` keeps the key paths and the
  string values both, since either losing its path leaves the mod holding a hash it cannot name.
- **The keys are what `preview` draws for a `HashKeyValue`,** because they are the half that can
  fail. A key no table names is the one row still without a repair, and it now takes the rule's
  existing sentence about an unresolvable hash rather than the one telling the reader to rebuild.

`RowConversion` is left alone. The two roads are derived from the schema, never written in a table,
which is already true of `NullPointer`.

`Conversion` is `pub`, so this adds two variants to a public enum. `ltk-manager-core` is a workspace
member with one consumer and no release, so the contract is the workspace's own. Worth a
`#[non_exhaustive]` if that ever stops being true.

## 6. Not doing

**Widening the table to cover 16.18.** A table is a claim about one build and a hand-audited file,
and the database already carries what 16.18 changed. The rule was built to prefer the database for
exactly this, and adding a `binfile_migration_16.18.8159717.jsonl` would put the same 395-row audit
burden on a patch the database answers for free.

**Repairing `Link` to `Hash`.** `kinds::NAMES` holds no entry for `Link`, so `Shape::written`
returns `None`, the revision carries no shape and `objection` is silent. That is the documented
behaviour for a type name the mapping does not hold, and the three audio properties it affects are
not what was reported. It is a separate question from this one.

**Changing `describes` itself.** It gates every reader of the schema, not only this rule, and the
class card depends on its current meaning. Section 5.2 puts the decision in `Judge::lens`, which is
the rule's own.
