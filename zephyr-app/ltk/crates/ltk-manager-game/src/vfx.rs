//! One particle system as a resolved value tree: every reference chased, every asset
//! path located, and nothing else read.
//!
//! Reference resolution is Rust's and evaluation is TypeScript's, per "Rust resolves
//! references. TypeScript evaluates them" in docs/plans/vfx-particle-renderer.md. The
//! tree is generic for that reason: no field name is mapped and no value is interpreted.
