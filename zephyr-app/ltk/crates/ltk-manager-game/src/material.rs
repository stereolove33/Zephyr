//! What a `StaticMaterialDef` gives a preview: the slots one stock material draws with.
//!
//! The engine binds a material by name against the `CustomShaderDef` its pass links, so
//! a preview that translates no shader picks its base texture, its tint and its render
//! state by name too. The name lists, their order and their guards are the ones
//! measured on every shipped material, section 2 and section 6.1 of
//! docs/research/static-material-studio-rendering.md, and an absent field reads as the
//! class default rather than as unset, which is rule 1 of that note's section 1.1.
