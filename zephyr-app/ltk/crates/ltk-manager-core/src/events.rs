//! Backend → frontend notifications, decoupled from any particular UI.
//!
//! Domain code emits [`BackendEvent`]s through an [`EventSink`] rather than
//! calling into Tauri. The Tauri shell supplies a sink that maps each variant to
//! an `app_handle.emit(name, payload)` call; a CLI would map the same variants
//! to progress bars or log lines.
//!
//! The enum is also the single registry of event names. Before this, names were
//! scattered string literals at each emit site with no compile-time link to the
//! frontend listeners, so the two could drift silently.
