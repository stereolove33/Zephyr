//! Line-protocol client for the injection host process.
//!
//! The host process owns all injection logic and communicates with us over a
//! line-oriented protocol on stdin (commands) and stdout (events). Split into:
//!
//! - `protocol` - the wire protocol: keywords, session config, event parsing
//! - `process` - spawning and driving a single host child process
//! - `persistent` - the long-lived [`PatcherHost`] reused across sessions
