//! An installed mod's readme and license, read wherever the format left them.
//!
//! A modpkg's readme is written into the mod directory at import and a
//! fantome's is not, so the first ask for one mounts the archive and writes it
//! where the modpkg import already would have. Both formats converge on
//! `README.md` in the mod directory, and every later ask is a file read.
//!
//! A license text reaches disk for neither format and is not cached here. It is
//! read once, rarely, and only when a reader asks to see it.
