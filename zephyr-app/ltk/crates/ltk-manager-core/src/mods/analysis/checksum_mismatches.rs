//! Transient record of checksum mismatches from the most recent overlay build.
//!
//! A mismatch is a chunk whose container claimed a checksum its own bytes do
//! not have - the mark of a badly-packed mod, worth re-exporting. Per upstream
//! ADR-0001 it is never a build failure: the overlay carries the checksum
//! recomputed while the bytes were copied, so the content reaches the game
//! intact either way. Like [`crate::mods::LinkedBinState`] this is in-memory
//! only and replaced wholesale on every build, because only chunks a build
//! actually passed through are observed - a WAD reused from a previous build
//! reports nothing.
