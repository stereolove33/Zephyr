//! The meta schema: what type the game expects every bin property to hold.
//!
//! A bin writes one type tag per value, and the game compares it against its
//! own registrar by exact byte equality - no coercion, no widening. A tag that
//! does not match is thrown away, the member keeps its constructor default, and
//! the load reports success, so a mistyped property is silent data loss.
//!
//! **A revision is keyed on a build, so a lookup needs one.** A field is
//! `String` before a build and `File` after it, and neither is wrong in itself.
