Each edit of this document adds a row at the top. The table keeps the last ten rows.

The project editor is the LTK Manager screen for work on one mod project. The core design
idea is an IDE for League mods. A user opens a project, reads its content, changes what the
mod declares, and packs the result.

The header row and the bar in it are drawn by the workshop shell over both of its routes, so
what they mean outside a project is [Workshop](WORKSHOP.md). This document describes them from
inside one.

## Goals

- A new modder can find the first step without a guide
- Each action has one clear place in the layout
- Features that do a lot stay simple to reach
- The layout follows an editor that most users already know

## Feature status

This table holds every major feature of the editor. A status word has one meaning.

- **Available** - the feature is in the application today
- **In progress** - work started, and the feature is not complete
- **Planned** - the team agreed on the feature, and work did not start
- **Proposed** - an idea for review, and not a decision
- **Blocked** - the team agreed on the feature, and a change outside this repository has
  to land first

## Scope

The editor separates two kinds of content, and treats them in opposite ways.

**Declarative data.** The project declares this data in its own configuration. The overlay
builder applies it when the manager patches the mod into the game. A user edits declarative
data in the editor.

**Assets.** These are the game files that the mod ships, such as a texture, a mesh or a
`.bin` file. The editor reads an asset and can show a preview. It does not change the bytes
of an asset. A user manages which files a layer holds, and edits a file itself elsewhere.

The [game browser](#game-browser) reads the assets of the installed game under the same
rule. It never writes into the game directory. A copy into a layer and an extract to disk
are its two outputs.

### Declarative data

| Data               | Status    | Order  | Reference                                 |
| ------------------ | --------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| String overrides   | Available | -      | -                                         |
| Property bin links | Planned   | First  | `LeagueToolkit/league-mod` issue **#190** |
| PTCH targeting     | Planned   | Second | `LeagueToolkit/league-mod` issue **#191** |

A property bin link lets a project declare the links to add to a `.bin` file, and the
target of each link. PTCH targeting lets a project declare a patch container and the
targets that receive it. The game client applies the patch under its own rules.

Property bin links come first in the editor. PTCH targeting follows it.

Both are future additions. The editor design for them comes later, and this document does
not describe one yet.

### Game data

A layer's `game_data` manifest opens as a document of its own, from its row in the layer
files or from the Declarations view. The document has two views.

| View    | What it shows                                                           |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Outline | Each module, then its overrides, entries, keys and links in apply order |
| Raw     | The manifest's text, read-only, with its line numbers                   |

The toolbar names the manifest's file and counts its modules and keys.

#### Rows

Every row is one line, and the outline reads the way the manifest does.

| Row      | What it shows                                                                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Module   | Its name, what it edits, the comment above it, and a count of its objects and keys  |
| Override | A `.ptch` file the module applies to its chunk                                      |
| Entry    | An object the module edits, creates (`new` and its class) or removes (struck out)   |
| Key      | A signed property path, then its value in a column every key of the document shares |
| Link     | A dependency the module adds to its chunk's list, or removes from it                |
| Empty    | Under a module that declares nothing yet, where to drag entries                     |
| New      | The line that ends each layer and adds a module to it                               |

A module is named by its place in the manifest, `Module 1`, until the manifest spells a name
for it. A `target` module names its chunk's file, the full path on hover. The comment lines
directly above a module are its note: the block a remove or a move carries with it.

An entry or a class spelled as a hash reads as the name the hashtables know for it, the hash
beside it as a chip.

A key's value fits its row. A one-line value reads as spelled, a game-copy reference as a link,
and a struct as its kind and class, whether the manifest spells it as a tag or as `pointer:`
with a `class`. A block list folds into brackets and a block mapping into braces, a nested
value standing as `…`. The full value is on hover, and Show in text selects its lines in Raw.

A key's Go to row, or `Enter` on the key, opens the game bin that declares the entry, on the
row the key reaches. The object index gives the chunk: the one a `target` module names, else
the first in the index's order. A path through a map key reveals the map's own row. An object
the module creates is in no game bin, so it has no Go to row.

#### Module actions

A row's context menu and a module's kebab carry the same list. The Declarations view offers
them on its rows too, and lists every layer, one with no manifest included, each ending in a New
module line.

| Action               | Where                   | Key         | What it does                                              |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rename               | Module                  | `F2`        | Types over the name in place. Empty clears it             |
| Write new edits here | `entries` module        |             | Makes it the module a declared edit joins                 |
| Move up, Move down   | Module                  | `Alt+↑` `↓` | Moves it one place in the apply order                     |
| Remove module        | Module                  | `Delete`    | Asks, then takes it and the comment above it out          |
| Move to module       | `entries` entry and key |             | Carries the keys to another `entries` module              |
| New module           | Layer, module, New line | `Enter`     | Adds an unnamed module at the end and types over its name |
| Show in text         | Any row                 |             | Opens Raw with the row's lines selected                   |

New module writes a module with no entry, `entries: {}`, which league-mod loads as a module
that applies nothing (ADR-0054). Move to module ends with New module, which makes a module and
moves the keys into it, then types over its name. A layer with no manifest offers New module
in its empty document, and the first module starts the manifest.

A named module stays when a move or a drop takes its last entry. An unnamed one goes.

Rows drag to organize the manifest. A module dragged over another lands above it when that one
is ahead of it and below it otherwise, and a line marks where. An entry or a key of an `entries`
module lands in the `entries` module it is dropped on, which the drop tints. Nothing drags across
layers, and a `target` module takes no dropped entry. Module rows carry Move up and Move down on
hover beside the kebab.

A double click on a module renames it too. Write new edits here also selects the module's layer,
since a declared edit writes to the selected layer (ADR-0048). The chosen module carries the
New edits mark.

Remove is the one action with a question, because nothing here undoes it. The actions write
the manifest's text and every open declared document applies it again.

A manifest that does not load opens on its text, with the line the error names marked and
selected. The error is under the text. The outline and the view follow the file: a declared
edit and a return to the window both read it again.

Raw reads. Keys are written through the declared bin (ADR-0042), or outside the app.

## Layout

The screen has four regions.

```

1. The project header names the project and holds the actions that apply to the whole
   project.
2. The rail is the column of views down the outer edge. It answers the question "where do I
   look?"
3. The primary side panel holds the view the rail selected. It answers the question "what
   can I change in this mod?"
4. The editor surface holds the open documents behind a tab row.
5. The secondary side panel holds the file tree of the selected layer, and the inspector
   for the selected file. It answers the question "which file?"

Regions 2 to 5 together are the **content browser**. The project header is above the content
browser and is not part of it. The code uses the same name for the same region.

A user can hide each side panel. The layout control in the project header sets which side
each panel takes, and which panel shows. The rail takes the same side as the primary panel
and stays on screen while that panel is hidden.

This arrangement is the default. The [panel layout](#the-panel-layout) lets a user build a
custom arrangement instead.

## Project header

The header carries the project identity, the actions for the whole project, and the one
control that answers for the whole view.

| Control  | Meaning                                                                 |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `←` `→`  | Walks the project's navigation history                                  |
| Bar      | Names the project, and searches it. The crumb in it returns to Workshop |
| Layout   | Sets which side each side panel takes, and whether one shows            |
| Test     | Builds the overlay and starts the patcher                               |
| Pack     | Writes the distributable archives, to the formats on its caret          |
| Overflow | Opens the project folder, or deletes the project                        |

The back arrow and the project name title are both gone. The bar took the name, the version
tag and the route back to the project list. Read [the project bar](#the-project-bar).

The row itself belongs to the shell, which draws the same five slots over the project grid and
refills them rather than swapping the chrome. What the slots hold there, and how the row
balances around the bar, is [Layout](WORKSHOP.md#layout).

## Packing

Pack writes as it is pressed. There is no dialog: the button turns to Packing while the
project is written, and the outcome arrives as a toast. A creator packs many times while
working on a release, and a dialog with one useful button made every one of those a second
press.

The caret beside Pack holds the formats a press writes: **Both formats**, the default,
`.modpkg` or `.fantome`. The choice is the creator's rather than the project's, so it is
remembered across projects. The caret matches the one beside Test, and Pack's tooltip names the
formats a press writes.

A `.fantome` carries every layer. The base layer's WADs go under `WAD/`, every other layer's
under `WAD_<layer>/`, and the layer table in `META/info.json` (league-mod ADR-0036).

The pre-flight check runs on the press. Errors stop the pack and become an error toast that
lists them. Warnings do not stop it, and the toast of a pack with warnings lists them under the
file names.

A packed toast names the files written and offers **Show in Explorer**. A pack the rules left
something out of offers the count as a second action, which opens the ignore rules. The content
tree marks what the rules exclude, so the toast does not list it again.

The same Pack runs from a card, the card menu, the palette and a grid selection, and every one
of them shows the same busy state, because a pack outlives the menu that started it. A selection
packs to the same formats and reports on one summary toast.

## The project bar

The header's middle holds one control. It names the project while nothing is happening, and it
is the route to every file, every command and every path of the game as soon as a user types
in it. To its left are the two arrows that walk the navigation history.

The same control stands over the project grid, where it names the workshop and filters the
cards. Its three modes, and which one a click and `Ctrl+F` each land in, are
[The bar](WORKSHOP.md#the-bar).

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ←  →   ⌕ Workshop / Charizard Smolder X  v1.0.0   Ctrl+P    ⬓  Test  Pack  ⋮ │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  history        the project bar, idle                       view, and project
```

This replaces the project name that the header carried on the left. A title is the one thing in
a header that a user never clicks, and it held the widest part of the row. The bar reads as the
same identity and answers a question as well.

### Why one control

A project editor gathers a lot of routes. There is a file tree for each layer, a locale table
for each locale, a tree over 819,136 game files, a list of archives, the details form and the
actions of the header. Each has a place in the layout, and each costs a user two or three moves
to reach.

One box takes every one of them in a keystroke. This is the shape that Visual Studio Code,
GitHub and every browser use, so a user arrives already knowing it.

The bar removes no route. The primary side panel still lists the layers, the tree still holds
the files, and the game browser still opens from the project row. The bar is the fast path over
the same surface, and it is the one control a user needs to learn to find anything.

### The idle state

| Part        | Reads                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Glyph       | A magnifier, so the box reads as a search and not as a title |
| Crumb       | `Workshop`, and a click on it returns to the project list    |
| Separator   | `/`                                                          |
| Name        | The project's display name                                   |
| Version tag | The version of the mod, as the title carried it              |
| Hint        | `Ctrl+P`, dim, at the trailing edge                          |

The crumb is what the back arrow of the old header did. Three arrow glyphs in a row is a row
that a user has to read twice, so the route out of the project moves into the bar and the two
arrows beside it mean one thing.

The bar takes the width between the history arrows and the action group, to a limit of 720px,
and centers itself in that space. A window twice as wide does not want a search box twice the
width, because a path is the longest thing the box ever holds.

### The expanded state

A click on the bar, or `Ctrl+P`, turns it into the input. The crumb and the version tag give
way to the caret, the results drop below the bar at the bar's own width, and a scrim dims the
editor under them. `Escape` returns the bar to idle.

```

A row carries the name, a dim path under it and its source at the trailing edge. The matched
characters of the name and of the path are marked. A group header names its source and the
count of what matched, and a group is capped so no source pushes another off the list.

### What it searches

| Source    | Rows                                            | Where the data is        |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Files     | Every file of every layer                       | The content tree query   |
| Layers    | The layers of the project                       | The project record       |
| Strings   | The keys and values of every locale override    | The layer content        |
| Documents | The open tabs                                   | The editor store         |
| Commands  | The actions of the header, the editor, settings | A registry               |
| Game      | Every file of the installed game                | The backend's game index |
| Objects   | Every bin object the install declares           | The bin object index     |

Files reads every layer and not the selected one, the rule the [tree search](#search) already
obeys. A result names the layer that holds it, because a relative path is the same string in
every layer.

Game is the source with a cost. Read [The scan of the game](#the-scan-of-the-game).

Objects is the source with a blocker. Read [The bin object index](#the-bin-object-index).

### The setting

The Project editor section of the settings gains one row, **Search the game**. Every source is
on by default.

One switch rather than one per source, because Game is the only one that costs anything. The
rest read what the frontend already holds, so a switch on any of them would save a scan of a
few thousand rows that nobody can measure and would leave a user wondering why a file they can
see in the tree does not come back.

The switch that matters is Game. A modder who never copies a game file pays nothing for the
scan, and a modder who does gets the whole install in the same box as their own project. The
setting belongs to the application and not to the project, because it describes how a user
works rather than what a project holds. It sits beside **Preview on a single click** in the same
section, and `workshopLayout` persists it.

### Scopes

A user narrows the box to one source, and there are two ways to ask.

- `Tab` on a highlighted row scopes to that row's source. `Tab` on a group's `… n more` row
  does the same for the whole group
- A prefix typed at the start of the query scopes without a highlight

| Prefix | Scope                                                                    |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `>`    | Commands                                                                 |
| `#`    | The string override keys of the project                                  |
| `$`    | The bin objects of the install                                           |
| `@`    | Inside the active document: a bin or object tab's rows, by name or value |
| `?`    | A list of these prefixes                                                 |

A scope shows as a chip before the caret. `Backspace` on an empty query removes it. Game has no
prefix, because it is in the default result set and `Tab` reaches it.

`Ctrl+Shift+P` opens the bar with the Commands scope already set, which is the binding a user
brings from Visual Studio Code. `Ctrl+K` is an alias of `Ctrl+P`.

### Keys

| Key            | Does                                                |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl+P`       | Opens the bar. `Ctrl+K` is the same                 |
| `Ctrl+Shift+P` | Opens the bar in the Commands scope                 |
| `↑` `↓`        | Moves the highlight, across a group header          |
| `Enter`        | Runs the row's action                               |
| `Ctrl+Enter`   | Opens into a group beside the focused one           |
| `Alt+Enter`    | Opens as a permanent tab while the reuse mode is on |
| `Tab`          | Scopes to the highlighted row's source              |
| `Backspace`    | Removes the scope chip, on an empty query           |
| `Escape`       | Returns the bar to idle                             |

An empty query lists the documents of the history, most recent first, and then the commands.
`Ctrl+P` and `Enter` is therefore the switch back to the last file, with no query typed.

### Commands

A command is a record, and the module that owns the action owns the record.

```ts
interface ProjectCommand {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  group: string;
  /** Words a user might type that the title does not hold. */
  keywords?: readonly string[];
  shortcut?: string;
  /** False greys the row and states why. A pack with no layers cannot run. */
  enabled?: boolean;
  run: () => void;
}
```

`useProjectCommands` composes the list out of the modules' own hooks, so a command closes over
the real mutation rather than over a copy of it. Nothing registers into a global table at
import time, and a command that needs project state reads it the way every other panel does.

The first set is the actions the editor already holds: Test, Pack, Open project folder, Delete
project, Mod details, Game index, Game WADs, Rebuild the game index, Reset the layout, Split
right, Split down, Pin the tab, Lock the group, the four closes, and the routes into the
settings.

**Go to** holds a route to each document the project owns on its own: Mod details, the game
index, the game WADs, the objects browser, the problems list, the readme, the license, the
ignore rules and the references. A route to a document already open activates the tab it sits
in. A route to a file the project does not hold yet opens the document that writes it.

**View** holds the four closes, the reopen and the maximize beside the splits, the pin and the
lock. Each close acts on the focused group and its active tab, through the queue that group's
surface published. A dirty document asks the question it asks from the strip's own menu. A close
with nothing to take is disabled and names what holds it: a strip of pinned tabs alone, or a
tab with nothing to its right. **Reopen the closed tab** puts the newest closed tab back, per
[Reopening a closed tab](#reopening-a-closed-tab), and is disabled with **Nothing closed yet**
while the project has closed none. **Maximize the panel** reads **Restore the panel** while a panel fills
the grid, and gives the tree back whichever group that panel belongs to.

## The scan of the game

The project holds hundreds of files and the install holds 819,136. One box reads both, and the
two want opposite treatment.

**Whatever the frontend already holds, the frontend matches. Whatever only the backend holds,
the backend matches.** The content tree query returns every layer's files already, the store
holds the open tabs, and the command list is built in the frontend. The game index lives in
Rust and its paths never cross IPC as a whole. This gives one scorer in each language, which is
not a duplication this design creates. Each side needs a scorer whatever the other side does.

### The project side

A project of a few thousand candidates needs no index. A scan of a flat array per keystroke is
well under a frame, and the cost that shows up is not the matching.

- One flat array of candidates, built with `useMemo` from the content tree, the layers, the
  locales, the open tabs and the commands
- Each candidate carries its lowercase forms, computed once at build. A `toLowerCase` per row
  per keystroke is the real cost, and this removes it
- Each candidate carries a 32-bit mask of the letters it holds. A query whose mask is not a
  subset of a candidate's cannot match, so one `AND` rejects most rows before the matcher reads
  a character
- The scan runs in the render pass. A worker is the answer to a measurement, and no measurement
  asks for one yet

### The backend side

The backend answers a query and returns the top rows. The frontend debounces by 120ms, keeps
the previous game section on screen while the next one arrives, and renders the project rows
without waiting for either.

`GameIndex` holds a directory arena, and each directory holds its files. A search wants a flat
list of paths, and building 819,136 of them for each query would allocate more than the match
costs. Three things make the scan cheap instead.

1. **A letter mask on each file and each directory.** A file's mask covers its name. A
   directory's mask covers its own path, and a second mask covers the union of its subtree. A
   query mask that is not a subset of the subtree mask skips that subtree whole, and a query
   mask that is not a subset of `directory path mask | file name mask` skips that file before
   its path is built. `File` is 48 bytes today, of which four are padding, so the mask on a file
   costs nothing at all.
2. **One reusable buffer.** The walk is depth first and pushes and pops a segment on a single
   `String`, so a path that survives the mask is built with no allocation.
3. **A bounded heap.** A fixed min-heap of the top 100 by score. Nothing sorts a million rows.

A query carries a generation, and an `AtomicU64` beside the index holds the newest one. The
scan tests it every few thousand files and returns nothing once it is stale. Without this a
ten-character query queues ten full scans, and the last of them is the only one anybody wants.

The command runs on `spawn_blocking`, the way `read_dir` and the index build already do.

### Ranking

Both scorers obey one rule, and a fixture of query and candidate pairs is checked into both
test suites so the two agree on order.

A query is split on whitespace, and every term has to appear as a run of characters. This is the
search a file manager does, and the one a modder expects of a path.

| Signal                                              | Effect                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| The file name opens with the query                  | Highest band                                  |
| Every term is somewhere in the file name            | Second band                                   |
| The terms are found over the directory part as well | Third band                                    |
| A term begins after `/`, `_`, `.`, `-` or a capital | A bonus, for each                             |
| A term is a whole word rather than part of one      | A bonus, for each                             |
| A term appears nowhere in the candidate             | No match at all                               |
| The candidate is in the selected layer              | A bonus                                       |
| The candidate is in the navigation history          | A bonus, decaying with its depth in the stack |
| Two candidates score the same                       | The shorter path wins                         |

### The budget

These are targets and not measurements. The install they are sized against is the one that
[the game index](#the-game-index) measures, at 456 archives and 819,136 files.

| Stage                                     | Budget                                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| A keystroke to the project rows on screen | 16ms                                        |
| A keystroke to the game section           | 150ms, of which 120ms is the debounce       |
| The search structure of the game index    | Built with the index, in no extra pass      |
| The memory the masks add                  | Nothing on a file, 240KB on the directories |

**A subsequence match is the wrong default here, and this is what replaced it.** `nasus` has its
five letters in that order inside nearly every long asset path, so as a subsequence it matched
137,032 files of a live install and buried the four a modder wanted. Scoring alone did not
rescue it: the good rows outscored the noise, and there was still a wall of noise under them.
Requiring a run removes the question. A fuzzy mode can come back as a setting if anyone asks for
one, and it is not the default.

Groups are ordered by their own best row rather than by a fixed source order, for the same
reason: a project holding no `nasus` still answers with whatever it can scatter the query
across, and a fixed order put that above the install's own `nasus.bin`. The declared order is
the tiebreak.

A trigram index over the game paths is the escalation, and it is not the first move. It costs a
build pass and a hundred megabytes, and it serves a substring query rather than the subsequence
query a palette asks for. A pruned linear scan over 819,136 short strings is interactive
already, and a measurement is what should buy anything more.

## The bin object index

The game's content is not authored as files. It is authored as objects with paths, and the
`.bin` files are how the packaging step ships them. Riot describes that split in
[Content efficiency and the game data server][gds], where the game data server addresses
content by path and the file that carries it stops being the interesting part.

[gds]: https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/content-efficiency-game-data-server

A modder works the same way. The thing they want is
`Characters/Aatrox/Skins/Skin0/Resources`, and the question they have to answer first is which
`.bin` declares it - one of the install's 42,306, or one of their own project's. Nothing in the
manager takes that string today. [The project bar](#the-project-bar) is the box that should.

The source is worth its own section because it is the one search source with a build behind it
that the manager does not have yet, and because that build waits on a change to `ltk_meta`.

### What a row is

```
│ OBJECTS · 359,095                                       12 │
│  ◈ Characters/Aatrox/Skins/Skin0/Resources                 │

│    SkinCharacterDataProperties     Aatrox.wad/…/skin0.bin  │
```

| Part   | Reads                                                                |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name   | The object's path, with the matched characters marked                |
| Class  | The class the object declares, such as `SkinCharacterDataProperties` |
| Source | The `.bin` that declares it, and the archive or the layer it is in   |

An object that several files declare has a row for each declaration, and the source column
is what tells them apart. Nothing folds them, because a modder diffing two declarations wants
both on screen.

`Enter` opens the declaring `.bin` as a preview document, the same target a game row opens,
and `Ctrl+Enter` opens it beside. The target carries the object's hash from the first day, so
when the [bin editor](BIN_EDITOR.md) lands the same row scrolls to the object, which is a
position the [navigation history](#the-position-a-document-restores) can restore.

An object that no hash table names still has a row, under its hash in hex. A query of eight
hex digits is looked up in the index directly rather than matched, because a modder holding a
hash pasted it out of another tool.

### The two halves

**The names come from the mimir cache. The locations come from a scan of the install.** Neither
half holds the other's data, and this is what keeps the whole feature cheap.

| Half      | Holds                                    | Costs                                         |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Names     | Every object path CommunityDragon knows  | Nothing. The cache is shared                  |
| Locations | Object hash to the files that declare it | A scan of the install, and one of the project |

The `binentries` table of the [mimir cache](#hash-names) holds 421,835 object paths in 2.2MB
on disk, and the manager already opens that cache for the WAD path tables. A bin object path
hashes to 32 bits, so the table answers hash to name and `hash_path` answers name to hash.

The scan answers the other direction. It reads what each `.bin` declares and keeps
`(object hash, class hash, file)`, and nothing else. The file is the declaring chunk's WAD
path hash, which survives a rebuild of the game index and resolves to a name and an archive
through it. 383,357 declarations at 16 bytes is 6.1MB.

The palette therefore matches a query against the table's strings and turns each survivor into
a file through the index. The install declares 359,095 distinct objects and the table names
325,357 of them, so the two agree on nine rows in ten. A name the install does not declare
never reaches the list, because the index answers no file for it.

### The project's own objects

The install is one source of locations. The project is the other, and it is the one a modder is
editing.

A layer's `.bin` files are loose on disk, and a project holds tens of them rather than 42,306.
That changes three things.

|            | The install                         | The project                                |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| The reader | `BinStream::entries`, an 8-byte hop | Either one. The eager read runs at 250MB/s |
| The build  | 42,306 files, built at startup      | Rebuilt with the content tree query        |
| The match  | Rust, and the rows stream in behind | The frontend, in the same frame            |

The third row is the seam that [The scan of the game](#the-scan-of-the-game) already draws.
Whatever the frontend holds, the frontend matches. The project's objects cross IPC once with
the content scan, so a few hundred bins declaring a few thousand objects become a smaller array
than the file list beside it, and the rows render without a debounce.

The first row was the reason this half was to ship first, while the install's reader waited
upstream. That reader landed, so the install's half ships first and this one follows it as its
own change. [What ships in what order](#what-ships-in-what-order) has the order.

**A layer row names its layer**, the way a Files row does, and the group is its own.

```
│ OBJECTS · Charizard Smolder X                            2 │
│  ◈ Characters/Smolder/Skins/Skin0                          │
│    SkinCharacterDataProperties    base · overrides Smolder │
│ OBJECTS · game                                          12 │
│  ◈ Characters/Smolder/Skins/Skin0                          │
│    SkinCharacterDataProperties    Smolder.wad/…/skin0.bin  │
```

An object that both sides declare is an override, and the row says so. That line is the
cheapest answer the editor has to "does my mod already change this?", and it costs a lookup in
the install's index against a hash the project's index already holds. The
[merged layer view](#ideas-for-review) answers the same question for files.

**The scan runs with the content tree query and keeps nothing.** A modder edits a `.bin` in
Visual Studio Code and comes back, so an index that outlives that edit is an index that lies.
The refresh control of the layer document already reloads the content tree, and the objects
come with it. Nothing about the project is written into `.ltk`, and no checksum decides what to
rebuild, because rescanning a project's bins is cheaper than working out which one moved.

**A path a modder invents has no string anywhere.** A bin stores the hash and not the path, so
an object nobody has published a name for reads as hex even in the modder's own project.
`LayeredHashDb` takes an overlay over its base tables, which is where a project-local list of
names belongs. Nothing writes one today.

### The scan, and the reader it needs

A `.bin` is a header, a list of class hashes, and then the objects. Each object is a `u32`
length, a `u32` path hash, and then its properties.

```
PROP                   the magic, or PTCH and then PROP        read
version                1 to 3                                  read
dependencies           a count, and a sized string for each    read
object count           u32                                     read
[class hash] × count   u32 each, in object order               read
  size        u32      the length of the object's body         read
  path hash   u32      what addresses the object               read
  properties           the object itself                       seek past
```

The scan wants eight bytes of each object and none of the rest. `ltk_meta::Bin::from_reader`
reads all of it: an `IndexMap` for each object, a `PropertyValueEnum` for each property, and a
`String` for each string. Over the same 194.8MB of already-decompressed bins, the header scan
costs **3.1ms** and the full parse costs **760ms**. That is 242 times the work for a field the
header carries anyway.

Over a whole install the difference is the whole feature. The scan adds 14ms to a build that
spends its time in zstd, and the full parse would add about nine seconds to it.

### The reader it has

**`ltk_meta` has the lazy read, and it is `BinStream`.** It landed in `ltk_meta` 0.8.1 as the
answer to league-toolkit issue **#192**, and the workspace has compiled it since 2026-09-03,
when the problems pass began mounting every bin of a project through it. The format stays
upstream, where every other LeagueToolkit tool wants the same read, and this repository keeps
no second bin parser.

The shape the index reads:

```rust
/// One row of the table of contents.
pub struct ObjectEntry {
    pub path_hash: BinHash,
    /// From the class table read at mount.
    pub class_hash: BinHash,
    /// Where the object's `u32` size field sits, and the size it declares.
    pub offset: u64,
    pub size: u32,
}

impl<R: Read + Seek, M: Default> BinStream<R, M> {
    /// Read the header, the dependencies and the class table, and stop.
    pub fn mount(source: R) -> Result<Self, Error>;
    pub fn version(&self) -> u32;
    pub fn dependencies(&self) -> &[String];
    /// Sweep the object table, one 8-byte hop an object, skipping every body.
    pub fn entries(&mut self) -> Entries<'_, R, M>;
    /// One object, materialised from its entry.
    pub fn object(&mut self, path_hash: impl Into<BinHash>) -> Result<Option<ObjectStream<'_, R, M>>, Error>;
}
```

`entries` is the header scan of the table above, and `object` is the second call that
materialises one object. `BinToc`, the cached sweep, is `Clone` and serialisable, so the index
can persist a file's table without holding the file open.

**A `PTCH` does not mount.** `BinStream::mount` refuses one, and the streaming form of a patch
bin is league-toolkit issue **#210**, open. Until it lands a `PTCH` reads eagerly through
`BinOverride::from_reader`, which is the fallback the problems pass already carries.

| Reader               | Wants                                        | Reads                |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| The object index     | Every object header, and no property         | `BinStream::entries` |
| The bin editor       | One file, whole                              | `Bin::from_reader`   |
| The problems pass    | Every object of a project's bins, once       | `BinStream::walk`    |
| Property bin links   | The objects of one file, to offer as targets | `BinStream::entries` |
| The linked bin check | The dependency list alone                    | `BinStream::mount`   |

The [bin editor](BIN_EDITOR.md#the-parse-is-not-the-problem) is the one reader the eager read
suits: one file parses in single-digit milliseconds, so it ships on `Bin::from_reader` and
takes the stream later as an optimisation.

`ltk_meta` is a dependency of the workspace, pinned by `Cargo.toml` to the league-toolkit rev
that carries the walk until a release does.

### The build, measured

Read on 2026-09-05 from the build's own `info` line, on a release build over an install of 392
archives, through the streaming reader on a warm file cache. The line is what the measurement
test in `src-tauri` logs, and the build it runs is the one the Objects switch warms. The
2026-08-20 figures the table carried before, read through the eager reader, stay in
[the research note](../research/bin-object-index.md) with the note on which of them did not
reconcile.

| Measurement                               | Value                                              |

| Distinct objects                          | 350,008                                            |
| Named by the mimir table                  | 321,980, which is 92.0%                            |
| Distinct classes                          | 382                                                |
| Files that would not scan                 | 3                                                  |
| The index, at 16 bytes a declaration      | 6.0MB                                              |
| Resolving every hash to its name, at load | 399ms                                              |

The build is decompression and nothing else. Every millisecond above belongs to zstd, so the
work spreads across archives: one job per archive in ordinal order, each mounting its archive
itself rather than through the browser's cache, on the bounded pool of workers the problems
pass uses, and the rows concatenated in archive order at the end. The game index build reads
its archives one at a time today, and stays that way.

Three files of 42,306 fail to scan. A file that will not scan is skipped and logged, and it
never fails the build, because a build that stops on one bad chunk in an install of a million
is a build that never finishes.

**An unnamed chunk is a bin by its first bytes.** The game index stores no kind, so a chunk no
table names is decoded far enough to read its magic and read whole only when it is a `PROP`
or a `PTCH`. The objects inside an unnamed bin are the case a modder holding a hash is in,
which is why the sniff is worth its decode.

**A chunk with a bare name is sniffed the same way.** Riot ships a UI scene's bin under a name
with no extension, `clientstates/gameplay/ux/chat/uibase` among them, and the `hash` values of the
view controller that loads it name the objects inside. A chunk whose extension names another kind
is not sniffed.

### Where it is kept

In memory, for the session, and rebuilt from the archives the next time the application
starts. Nothing is written to disk, and nothing will be on the figures above: the build costs
under half a second on a warm file cache, runs off the thread that draws the window, and sits
behind a switch that is off by default, so a cache would save less than keeping it correct
across a game patch and a table sync would cost. The decision and the line it was taken on are
in [the research note](../research/bin-object-index.md), section 10.

Were one ever asked for, the object table is a section of the memory-mapped cache that
[One cache, not two](#one-cache-not-two) describes, under the same archive checksums. A game
patch rebuilds the archives it changed and no others, and a format version in the header
forces a full rebuild when this manager writes the section differently.

**The cache holds hashes and no names.** The mimir tables update on their own schedule, so a
name written into the cache today is a name that can be wrong tomorrow. Resolving all 359,095
hashes at load costs 200ms against a table that is already mapped, which is less than the
cost of keeping a second copy correct.

### The dependency graph

A bin header names the files it imports, and the scan reads 121,665 of those edges on its way
past. **No search reads one.** The graph is worth keeping once it has a reader, because it is
the byproduct of an expensive pass and the answer to a question the editor cannot answer at
all today. The first cut reads the list and stores nothing, because nothing is on disk to
migrate when the first reader arrives with **#190**.

| Measurement                                     | Value                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Edges                                           | 121,665                                             |
| Resolving to a file the install ships           | 116,201, which is 95.5%                             |
| Naming a directory rather than a file           | 5,430, such as `Characters/PetBunny`                |
| Naming a `.bin` the install does not ship       | 34                                                  |
| Files with a dependent                          | 13,780                                              |
| Roots, meaning no dependent and some dependency | 25,911                                              |
| Isolated, meaning neither                       | 2,615                                               |
| A closure, on average                           | 5.5 files and 57 objects                            |
| The deepest chain                               | 5                                                   |
| The widest closure                              | 41 files, from `characters/evelynn/skins/skin0.bin` |
| Every closure in the install, computed          | 2.5ms                                               |
| The graph, at 8 bytes an edge                   | 0.9MB                                               |

An edge costs no string. A dependency is written as `DATA/Characters/Aatrox/Aatrox.bin`, which
is the archive path of the file it names, so the manager hashes it the way a WAD path hashes and
looks the result up in the game index. What survives is a pair of file ids.

The 5,430 that name no file are a second convention. `Characters/PetBunny` is not a path, and
the game resolves it by a rule this document does not know, so the index records those edges as
unresolved rather than guessing at one. The 34 that do name a `.bin` and still miss are the
interesting ones, because those are dependencies on content the install does not carry.

### Why the closure is not folded in

Folding a dependency's objects into the roots that reach them turns 383,357 declarations into
1,472,453 object-by-root pairs. Four times the storage is survivable, so that is not the
argument.

**The argument is the last two rows of the table.** Every closure in the install computes in
2.5ms over a graph of 0.9MB. A derived fact that cheap is one to compute, and storing it buys
nothing but a second thing to invalidate.

The fold also destroys the fact a search result needs. "Declared by" names the file to open in
order to change the object. "Reachable from" names the roots that load it. One row cannot carry
both, and a modder clicking a result wants the first.

So the index stores the edges in both directions and answers reachability as a query.

| Question                       | Reads                                  |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| What does this file import?    | The forward edges of one node          |
| What imports this file?        | The reverse edges of one node          |
| Which roots reach this object? | A reverse walk, over a graph five deep |
| What does this root load?      | A forward walk, 5.5 files on average   |

### What the graph is for

Not search. A palette row that said "in 47 roots" would be noise in the one place that has to
stay legible. The graph answers whether a reference resolves when the game loads it, which is a
different question with a different reader.

| Reader                                    | Asks                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Property bin links, `league-mod` **#190** | Which objects may this file link to, given what it imports?   |
| The problems list                         | Does a link point into a file that no root of this mod loads? |
| The linked bin check                      | Which files does this one need, so a mod ships all of them?   |
| The bin preview                           | What this file imports, as a header a reader can follow       |

The link picker is the case that pays. A link into a file the root never loads does nothing in
the game and passes every check the manager has, which is the failure the
[game archive check](#requirements) exists to catch for paths. The graph makes the same check
possible for links: offer the objects the file already reaches first, and warn on the rest.

None of that blocks the object index. The edges are stored because the scan reads them anyway,
and the first reader arrives with **#190**.

### Searching it

The project's objects match in the frontend, on the array the content scan already sent. The
install's match in Rust, because 325,357 names are not an array to send anywhere. Two scorers
for one source is the seam the palette already has for files, and not a second one.

The install's name side is a scan of the same shape as [the project side](#the-project-side),
over 325,357 candidates rather than a few thousand.

- One name list, built once from `get_batch` over the index's hashes when the index warms, and
  kept for the session. 21.1MB of text and 10 bytes of offsets for each entry. A hashtable
  sync re-resolves the names and leaves the rows alone
- A 32-bit letter mask on each name, so one `AND` rejects most rows before the matcher reads a
  character
- The bounded heap of [the backend side](#the-backend-side) and a generation token of its
  own, because this scan runs in Rust beside the game one for the same keystroke, and one
  counter shared by two commands would cancel the first with the second

| Stage                                | Budget                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| A keystroke to the project's objects | 16ms, in the render pass                     |
| A keystroke to the install's objects | 150ms, of which 120ms is the debounce        |
| The scan itself                      | Under a frame, at a third of the game's rows |
| The memory the name list holds       | 25MB, resident while the palette is used     |
| The memory the index holds           | 6.1MB, in memory                             |

Ranking follows [the same table](#ranking), with one addition. A segment boundary in an object
path is `/`, and the last segment is what a modder types, so a match in it takes the prefix
band that a file name takes.

**A `class:` term filters before the path matches.** A whitespace-separated term of the form
`class:foo` is read by the objects source and by no other, so it narrows the rows to the
classes whose name starts with `foo`, case-insensitively, or to the one class whose hash is
the eight hex digits given. The rest of the query matches the path as before. While the class
term is the last one typed and more than one class matches it, the group shows the matching
classes as rows with their row counts, and `Tab` completes the term the way it scopes to a
source today. Once one class remains, the object rows replace them.

### The scopes it adds

| Prefix | Scope                                             |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `$`    | Every bin object, the project's and the install's |
| `@`    | Inside an open `.bin`, the objects of that file   |

Without a prefix the objects source answers too, as an OBJECTS group capped low the way the
game group is, so a modder typing a skin's name meets the object beside the file without
being told `$` exists. Under `$` the cap is the game scan's hundred.

`@` already means "inside the active document". A bin document's contents are its objects, so
the scope needs no new rule and the index answers it as a range rather than a search.

**What the search reads** gains an Objects switch beside Game. The index is not built while
that switch is off, so a modder who never touches a `.bin` pays nothing for it. With it on,
the build warms at startup after the game index, off the thread that draws the window,
because the switch is the consent and a first `$` keystroke is the worst place for five
seconds of zstd. A query that arrives first gets the building row the game source shows. The
switch is off by default. Turning it on builds at once, turning it off drops the index and
its names, and the game browser's Rebuild control clears the object index with the game index
and warms both again while the switch is on.

### What it gives the rest of the editor

| Feature                                   | What the index supplies                          |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Property bin links, `league-mod` **#190** | The picker for a link's target                   |
| PTCH targeting, `league-mod` **#191**     | The picker for a patch's target                  |
| The bin preview                           | The outline of a file, without parsing it        |
| The linked bin check                      | A dependency edge that is read rather than found |
| The problems list                         | A link no file declares, or that no root reaches |

The two declarative types are the reason to build this before it is only a search source. Both
ask a modder to name an object, and a text field that accepts any string is a text field that
accepts a typo. A picker over 359,095 real objects does not.

### When a half is missing

| Missing             | The palette still                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| The mimir tables    | Matches no name. A pasted hash still finds its file    |
| The install's index | Answers for the project alone                          |
| Both                | Drops the object groups, the way any empty source does |

The second row is not a failure. It is where the editor sits between step 1 and step 3 below,
and a modder searching the objects of their own mod needs neither the install's scan nor the
change upstream.

### What ships in what order

| Step | Holds                                                                       | Status |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 1    | The lazy read upstream, `BinStream::entries` in `ltk_meta` 0.8.1            | Landed |
| 2    | The install's build behind the Objects switch, logged, and the `$` source   | Landed |
| 3    | Unnamed chunks, sniffed by their magic                                      | Landed |
| 4    | The `class:` filter and its completions                                     | Landed |
| 5    | The project's own objects and the override line. The `@` scope remains      | Landed |
| 6    | The measured row, and the cache decision, which went against one            | Landed |
| 7    | The object pickers that **#190** and **#191** want, and the edges they read | -      |

The install's half ships first, as one change from the build to the bar, because the whole
game's index is the ask and its reader landed before either half started. Steps 3 to 5 each
hang off step 2 alone and land in any order. The project's half is its own change, and the
override line on a project row is what joins the two.

## The navigation history

The two arrows to the left of the bar walk one stack, and it spans the workshop shell rather
than sitting under each project - a stop is a document in a named project or the project grid
itself, and a back that lands in another project routes to it. Read
[the navigation history](WORKSHOP.md#the-navigation-history). This is the Go Back of Visual
Studio Code and not the Back of a browser, so it answers where a user was in the editor rather
than which page the application showed.

```ts
interface HistoryEntry {
  documentId: string;
  leafId: string;
  /** Opaque to the stack. The document that wrote it is the one that reads it. */
  position: unknown;
}
```

What ships holds the document id alone. A document sits in exactly one group, so the group is
a lookup rather than a field, and no document supplies a position yet. The two return with
[the position a document restores](#the-position-a-document-restores).

| Rule                                                      | What the stack does                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| An open, an activate, a focus, a reveal or a palette jump | Pushes an entry                                                          |
| A scroll                                                  | Nothing. A position is read at a push and not at a move                  |
| The same document pushed twice in a row                   | Replaces the top entry's position                                        |
| A move after a back                                       | Drops the forward part, the way a browser does                           |
| A document closes                                         | Its entries leave the stack, so a back never lands on a tab that is gone |
| The stack passes 50 entries                               | The oldest one goes                                                      |

`Alt+←` and `Alt+→` are the keys, and the mouse's fourth and fifth buttons do the same. An
arrow with nothing behind it is disabled, and the tooltip of a live arrow names what it returns
to.

The stack belongs to the session. `.ltk/editor.json` holds the documents and the layout, which
is where a user left the project, and a history is how they got there. Restoring it a day later
hands a user a back button into a session they no longer remember.

### The position a document restores

A document supplies its own position through `useDocumentPosition(documentId, read, restore)`.
The store keeps the reader in a ref map and calls it at a push. A document kind that supplies
nothing restores its scroll and no more.

| Document     | Position                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Layer files  | The scroll offset and the selected row     |
| Strings      | The row index                              |
| Game index   | The scroll offset and the open directories |
| Game archive | The same                                   |
| Mod details  | The scroll offset                          |
| Preview      | Nothing. A preview holds one view          |

## Building the palette

The palette is a component of `@/components`, on the primitives the repo already wraps.

```
@/components/CommandPalette.tsx
  ├─ Dialog          the base-ui wrapper that is already there
  ├─ useVirtualizer  @tanstack/react-virtual, already a dependency
  └─ useListNav      ↑ ↓ ⏎ esc, and aria-activedescendant
```

`cmdk` was the first candidate. It is the right library for a palette over a menu of items and
the wrong one for this surface. Its value is its scorer and its list, and this design uses
neither. The scorer runs in the DOM over mounted rows, and a section over the game index cannot
mount its rows. Turning the filter off with `shouldFilter={false}` leaves the keyboard model,
which `useListNav` is sixty lines of. `Command.Dialog` would also pull a second dialog
implementation in beside base-ui, against the rule that module code reaches base-ui through
`@/components` alone.

### Accessibility

A virtualized listbox holds a window of its rows, so a row has to say where it sits.

- The input is `role="combobox"`, with `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls` and
  `aria-activedescendant`
- The list is `role="listbox"`, a group is `role="group"` with `aria-labelledby` on its header,
  and a row is `role="option"`
- Each row carries `aria-setsize` and `aria-posinset`, because the DOM holds a window and not
  the list
- Focus never leaves the input. The highlight moves through `aria-activedescendant`

### What ships in what order

| Step | Holds                                                                      | Status  |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| 1    | The bar, the crumb, the history arrows, and the project sources            | Shipped |
| 2    | The game source, its Rust scorer, and the generation token that cancels it | Shipped |
| 3    | The scope chips, the `@` scope, and the settings row                       | Part    |
| 4    | The Objects source, on [its index](#the-bin-object-index)                  | -       |

Step 1 needs no backend change at all. Every source it reads is in the frontend already.

Step 3 came forward as far as its sources allow. The chips, the `>` and `#` prefixes, `?` and
`Tab` all ship with step 1, because a scope costs little once the sources are a list. The
settings row ships with step 2, as the one switch that pays for itself. The `@` scope waits on
a document that can answer for its own contents.

### What it replaces

The [quick open](#search-and-the-project-bar) proposal. The bar is the floating box that proposal
asked for, in a place a user can see rather than behind a shortcut somebody has to tell them
about.

It replaces no search box. The tree's box filters the tree in place, which is a read of the
structure around a result, and the game browser's box does the same for its own tree. The bar
is the route straight to one thing. The two shapes answer different questions, and one
candidate array feeds both.

## The rail

The rail is a column of icons down the content browser's outer edge. Each one of the upper
group fills the primary side panel with a view of its own, and the panel shows one of them
at a time. This is the shape Visual Studio Code uses, and most users know it already.

| View           | What the panel fills with                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Explorer       | Content, WADs and Strings, the sections below                |
| Search         | Every file of the install the pattern matches                |
| Problems       | Everything the manager's checks found in this project        |
| Objects        | Every object the install declares, as a tree over its paths  |
| Declarations   | Each layer's game data modules and the entries they declare  |
| Game index     | The install's own directories, read one level at a time      |
| Source control | Version control for the declarative data. Under construction |

The showing view's icon carries an accent mark on the window's own edge. Pressing that icon
hides the panel, and pressing any icon while the panel is hidden reopens it on that view.
The rail itself never hides, so the routes into a project are on screen whatever the editor
grid holds. ADR-0038 is why the rail sits outside the panel it drives.

The panel header names the showing view and carries its kebab. The kebab holds what the view
offers that its body has no room for, and a view with nothing to offer draws none.

A view is a place a user looks rather than work they hold, so none of them is a tab. Where a
view is the narrow half of a document, the panel header's kebab opens that document, and the
item names the document rather than the view: Search offers the game index, because the find
results are one half of that browser. The command palette opens the same documents.

The lower group is the project's own documents, under a rule that marks them as a different
kind from the views above.

| Control             | Meaning                                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Mod details         | Opens the metadata editor as a document         |
| Readme              | Opens the project's `README.md` as a document   |
| Ignore rules        | Opens the project's `.modignore` as a document  |
| Open project folder | Shows the project directory in the file manager |

The metadata editor holds the display name, the version, the description, the thumbnail,
the categorization and the authors. It is a document and not a dialog, so a user can keep
it open beside a layer and switch between the two.

Source control gives a mod a history. A user can see what changed since the last known good
build, and can return to it. This suits a mod project, because the layers hold text data
definitions as well as binary assets. The implementation is out of scope for this document.

## Primary side panel

The primary side panel holds one view of the rail's list. Its header names that view, and
under the header is the row the view draws its own chrome into - a search box, a count, the
actions the view carries. The Explorer view is the map of the project, and its sections are
below.

### Content

The Content section lists every layer in the project. A click on a layer selects that layer.
The secondary side panel then shows the files of that layer.

A layer is the unit a modder thinks in. The base layer is the content that the project
starts from. Each other layer is a variant that the patcher can apply on top.

### WADs

The WADs section names the game archives that the selected layer changes. It reads the
files of the layer and groups them by their target WAD.

This section adds no new data. It answers one question that the file tree answers slowly.
The question is "which parts of the game does this layer touch?"

An archive row keeps its click for the file tree, and a hover action on the row opens a
[scoped game browser](#scope-to-one-archive) for it. The section then answers a second
question, which is "what else does that archive hold?"

### Strings

The Strings section lists the locales that the selected layer overrides. A click on a
locale opens a table of key and value pairs.

A string override is declarative. The manager applies the override when it patches the mod
into the game, so the mod does not ship a full translation file.

## Secondary side panel

The file tree is navigation and not a document. A tab holds work that a user reads or edits,
and a file tree is neither. The tree also stays open for a whole session, so a tab for it
costs the surface and returns nothing.

The secondary side panel gives the tree a home. A click in the tree opens the file in the
editor surface. This is the shape that Visual Studio Code uses, and most users know it
already.

The panel holds no other view today. It is still a generic host and not a file tree with a
border, so it accepts any panel from the [panel types](#panel-types) list. What the primary
panel holds comes from [the rail](#the-rail) instead.

This is the cheap form of the [panel layout](#the-panel-layout). A user chooses which panel
hosts which view, and a sash sets the width.

### File tree

The tree shows one layer at a time. The selection in the Content section sets the layer. A
search is the one exception, and it reads every layer.

- A directory row shows the count of the files below it
- A file row shows an icon for the file type, and the size of the file
- A run of directories that each hold one directory folds into one row
- The tree renders through a virtualizer, so the file count does not change the cost

#### What a row's menu holds

- **Open**, on a file row, which is the menu's route to what a double click does
- **Open in VS Code**, on a property bin, when the ritobin integration is set up
- **Copy Name** and **Copy Relative Path**
- **Reveal in Explorer**, on the row's own path
- **Ignore this file**, **Ignore this folder** and **Ignore all `.ext` files**, each writing
  one line into the project's `.modignore`
- **Stop ignoring** on a dimmed row the app's own line excluded, or **Show rule** where a
  broader pattern did
- **Delete**, on `Del`

#### Deleting a row

A delete takes what the row names. A file row takes the file, a directory row takes the
directory and everything below it, and a folded row takes the whole run its name spells out.

Every delete is confirmed, and not only the ones that look expensive. A layer file is often
the only copy of an edit and nothing here reaches the recycle bin, so being wrong costs the
same either way. What the confirmation varies is how much it says is going, and a
directory names the count of files below it before the button is in reach.

The confirmation opens on the row rather than in the middle of the screen. A tree is a
place as much as it is a list, and a modal in the centre asks the reader to carry the
row's identity across the gap and back. Anchored, the answer stands next to the question.

Everything else dims behind it, and the row itself is cut out of the dim. Blurring the row
the popover is pointing at would undo what the anchoring bought, so the scrim is drawn as
four strips around the row, with a ring on it to keep the gap from reading as a seam.

The path leads the popover, set on its own as mono text rather than quoted inside the
prompt. A folded row spells out five or six segments, and a path wrapped mid-segment
inside a sentence reads as prose, when it is the one thing on screen a reader has to check
character by character. The part the delete takes is the bright tail of it, and whatever
stays behind is dim.

The directories a delete empties go with it, up to the layer root. The listing is built from
files, so a directory holding none has no row and no size, and one left behind is a folder
the tree cannot show. It would still be what makes the layer read as non-empty to the
project validator.

### Search

A layer holds hundreds of files. A search box at the top of the panel is the fastest route
to one of them.

The box reads every layer of the project, and not the selected layer alone. A modder does
not always know which layer holds a file, and a search that reads one layer answers with
nothing in that case.

- The box matches the full relative path, and not the file name alone
- A match keeps every parent directory of the match, so the result is still a tree
- The tree expands to each match, and marks the matched part of each name
- A result groups under the name of the layer that holds it
- An empty box returns the tree to the selected layer
- `Ctrl+F` and `/` move the focus to the box

The layer group row is what a search across layers needs. A relative path is the same
string in every layer, so a flat result list cannot say which layer a row came from.

#### Search and the project bar

This box and [the project bar](#the-project-bar) read the same data. One candidate array
feeds both, and the two differ only in the front end.

| Route       | Shape                                     | Suits                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Search box  | Filters the tree in place                 | A read of the structure around the result |
| Project bar | A list under the header, and every source | A keyboard route straight to one thing    |

The quick open proposal is the bar. A floating box behind a shortcut asks a user to be told
that it exists, and a bar in the header does not.

### Expansion

The tree expands every directory today. For a layer with 446 files this fills the panel with
rows that carry no information, and a user scrolls before the first read.

- The first render expands to the first directory that holds more than one child
- An expand-all control and a collapse-all control are in the panel header. Collapse all is
  available on every tree, as a header button and as `Ctrl+←` on a focused tree, the key of
  Visual Studio Code's `list.collapseAll`
- `Alt`, `Shift` or `Ctrl` and a click on a chevron expand or collapse the whole subtree. A tree that loads a
  folder per request opens one level only, so a click never starts a fetch per descendant

### Size

A user asks "which part of this layer is large?" A pack size grows with no warning, and the
tree can answer this question at one look.

- A directory row shows the total size of the files below it, next to the count
- A bar behind the size shows the share of the layer that the row holds
- [Sorting](#sorting) orders each directory by name, by size or by file kind

### File type filter

A control filters the tree to one group of file types. This uses the file type that the
backend already reports, so the filter needs no new data. [Filtering](#filtering) names the
groups, and gives the same control to all three explorers.

### Asset inspector

A tree row in a side panel is narrow. It carries a name and one number, and no more. Every
other fact about a file belongs in the inspector below the tree.

| Field               | Source                                                    |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Path                | The content entry                                         |
| Size                | The content entry                                         |
| File type           | The content entry                                         |
| Target WAD          | The first segment of the relative path                    |
| Also in layer       | Every other layer of the project that holds the same path |
| Modified            | Needs a time field in the content scan                    |
| In the game archive | The game index of the game browser                        |
| Texture facts       | Needs a read of the texture header                        |

**Also in layer** is the field with the highest value for the lowest cost. The content tree
request already returns every layer in one payload, so the frontend can compute this field
with no change to the backend. A layer conflict is invisible in the editor today.

**In the game archive** is the field with the highest value overall. A path with a typo
passes every check in the manager and then does nothing in the game. This is the most common
fault in a new mod, and a check against the archive of the installed game finds it. The
[game index](#the-game-index) holds every path of the game, so this field arrives with the
game browser.

## Why the file tree is not a table

A proposal asked for a data grid with more columns to the right of the tree. The answer is
no, for two reasons.

First, there is no data for the columns. A content entry carries the path, the size and the
file type. A row shows all three already, as the label, the right rail and the icon. A
header row, a resize control and a sort arrow add chrome and no information.

Second, the tree now lives in a side panel, and a side panel is narrow. A table needs width.
A table that loses its width reads worse than the tree that it replaced.

The extra data is still worth the work. It goes to the asset inspector, which has the room
and describes one file at a time.

A table returns in the editor surface, and it does not return in the side panel. The
[details list](#the-details-list) is that table: the location gives it a flat set of rows to
draw, and the surface gives it the width. Both objections above hold for the side panel, and
the tree stays there.

These constraints hold wherever it draws.

- One `grid-template-columns` value, shared by the header row and every data row
- A fixed row height, because the virtualizer computes each row position from it
- A drop to the name column and the size column below a pane width of 640px
- A hand written row model, because the folded directory chains do not fit a flat table
- `role="grid"` for a flat list of one directory. A table that keeps the hierarchy stays
  `role="tree"`, because `role="treegrid"` changes what the arrow keys mean and a tree needs
  those keys for expand and collapse

## Ignore rules

A mod project can hold a `.modignore`, and everything that packs the project already reads it.
Pack filters through it, Test builds the overlay through the same filter, and one pattern that
does not parse fails the whole pack. What the manager adds is the surface for it, so a package
stops shipping the Photoshop file next to the textures exported from it.

The rules are gitignore syntax over `content/`. The one thing a creator guesses wrong is where a
pattern starts, so it is written into the file's own header, repeated on the syntax card, and
named here: a root pattern anchors at `content/`, which makes `/base/notes.txt` a file in the
base layer and `/content/base/notes.txt` a match for nothing.

The reasons, the source per default entry and the precedent from other tools are in
`docs/research/modignore-in-project-editor.md`.

### The file the UI writes

Every action writes `<project>/.modignore`, the root file, whatever layer the row sat in.

A `.modignore` works in any directory under `content/`, anchored at its own directory, and the
deeper file wins for its subtree. That is a power a project can use and not a choice the app
makes on a creator's behalf. One file is one place to look when a mod ships a file it should
not have, where a per-layer file turns that question into a walk. GitHub Desktop writes the
root `.gitignore` for the same reason.

A nested file is still readable. The tree draws a row for it and the row opens the same
document against that file.

### The default a project starts with

A new project, a fantome import and a modpkg import are all written a starter file. The text is
one constant, and it lists the source formats and the editor files that no game path uses,
grouped under comment headings under a header of four worked examples. The comments are the
teaching material, which is why the file is not a bare list.

A git import keeps whatever the repository holds, including nothing. The repository is its
author's, and a file written into a working tree the app did not create is a diff the creator
did not ask for.

A project that already exists is never written to. The default is offered in the document's
empty state and by the problems rule. Both write the file only when the creator clicks, so an
entry the creator deleted is not added back.

### What the tree draws

The tree shows dot-entries. A `.mayaSwatches` folder that the packer ships needs a row to act
on, and hiding it left the default file as the only handling it got.

An excluded row dims. The name drops to `text-surface-400` and the file-kind glyph loses its
hue for `text-surface-500`, because the hue is the half of a glyph that carries at that size.
The trailing seat swaps the size for a slashed eye, since a size is a fact about what ships.
The tooltip hangs off that mark rather than off the row, because the kind glyph already owns
one, and it names the pattern, the file it came from and its line.

A pruned folder dims, expands, and dims every row inside it.

Nothing else changes. A folder counts what it holds, so one holding a single excluded file out
of four still reads 4. Rows keep their alphabetical place and a search result carries the same
treatment. What ships is a property of a row, not a reason to move it.

### The three actions

The row menu holds Ignore this file, Ignore this folder, and Ignore all `.ext` files, in their
own group above Delete.

| Action                  | What it writes              |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Ignore this file        | `/<layer>/<relative path>`  |
| Ignore this folder      | `/<layer>/<relative path>/` |
| Ignore all `.ext` files | `*.ext`                     |

A path is anchored and names its layer because the file is the root one. An unanchored
`notes.txt` would match that name in every layer, which is a wider promise than the row the
creator clicked. Any segment holding `*`, `?`, `[`, `{`, `!` or `#`, or a leading space, is
escaped with a `\`, since the matcher reads those as syntax.

An extension is written raw. A creator who asks for every `.psd` means every `.psd`.

A toast reports the literal line written, in a `Code` chip, with one sentence of what it means,
and carries Undo and Open rules. The creator learns the syntax by reading what the app writes.

### Stop ignoring

A dimmed row whose own anchored line the app wrote offers Stop ignoring, which deletes that
line.

Where a broader pattern matched, the menu reads Show rule instead and opens the document at the
line that matched. The rule is a decision the creator made about a class of files, and deleting
it from a row would take out more than the row.

Nothing generates a `!` line. A negation cannot re-include a file under an excluded directory,
which is git's rule and the matcher's, so an offer to bring one back would fail for exactly the
rows a creator is most likely to try it on.

### The document

The project row opens Ignore rules as a document, so it sits beside a layer while the creator
works. Its tab glyph is the slashed eye on a new `doc-ignore` slate token, the one unsaturated
glyph among the document hues (DS-KIND-HUE).

The text fills the document and a mono gutter carries the line numbers the tooltips cite. The
toolbar is a `.modignore` chip, Add missing recommended rules where entries are missing, and the
save state.

The syntax is a bar along the bottom rather than a rail beside the text: four patterns and three
rules are two wrapped lines, where a rail spent a fifth of the pane on them and disappeared
entirely at the width that most needed the room. It collapses to its own header, and the wiki
link sits at the end of that header whether it is open or not.

It autosaves, following the Strings document, so the tab's dirty state is reserved for a save
that is blocked or failed.

A save is blocked by a line the matcher cannot compile. The failing line marks its number in
`danger-text` and the matcher's own message sits in a footer strip beside the save state. The
backend is what compiles a pattern, so a blocked buffer is a refused write rather than a check
this side ran first, and the file on disk is unchanged.

**Add missing recommended rules** appends the entries of the default the file does not already
hold, under a comment naming the day, and leaves everything else alone. Comparison is by pattern
text. It is an action and never fires on its own.

A project with no file at all renders the default as ghost text behind a centred card, so the
creator reads what the button writes before pressing it.

### What Pack reports

A pack the rules left something out of says how much on its toast, and the action opens this
document. The content tree marks the excluded entries, so that is where a creator reads what was
left out. A creator finding an empty layer in a package is the failure this closes.

A layer the rules empty is a warning in the pre-flight list, in the shape the other pre-flight
warnings take, and the pack goes ahead because a creator may mean it. A pattern that does not parse
keeps its line number and its file, in the pre-flight errors and in the pack's own failure alike.

### The problems rule

The problems pass checks only the files that a pack puts in the package. It applies the project's
ignore rules in the same way a pack does. A file the rules exclude is not checked, and no repair
writes it. A dot-file that is not excluded is checked like any other file. "What a run does" in
[PROJECT_PROBLEMS.md](PROJECT_PROBLEMS.md) describes the walk.

`project/working-file`, **Working file in package**, reports each packed file that the default
would exclude, such as a Photoshop source, a Maya swatch folder or a `.DS_Store`. It is a warning.
The game loads the package, and the package is larger than necessary. The fix writes the default,
and one fix clears every finding of the rule. The preview of each finding names the pattern that
excludes the file, such as `*.psd`, so the creator sees the syntax before the file exists.

The rule reports only for a workshop project that has no `.modignore` file:

- **A project with a `.modignore` is not reported.** An empty file, a file in a folder under
  `content/`, and a file that does not compile all count. If a creator removed an entry of the
  default, the rule does not add it back. Add missing recommended rules in the document adds the
  missing entries when the creator asks.
- **A project with no file to exclude is not reported.** A missing `.modignore` is not a problem
  when the default would exclude nothing. A warning on every older project could only be cleared
  by creating an empty file.
- **Library mods and archives are not reported.** The user does not edit their rules, and a
  library repair would write the file into the mod's storage.

A finding names a file, not the project, because the creator acts on the file. Clicking the
finding opens the file, as for any other finding.

### Freshness

A save or an action invalidates the content tree query, which refetches on window focus. An edit
made in another editor lands when the app is next focused. There is no watcher.

## The readme

A mod project holds a `README.md`, both pack formats ship it, and both imports restore it.
Nothing in the manager wrote it after the moment the project was created, so what a package
carried was a heading over the one-line description and never a word more. What the manager
adds is the surface for it.

The reasons, the source per point and the alternatives each decision was taken over are in
`docs/research/readme-in-project-editor.md`.

### What it is for, and what it is not

The readme is the long description a package ships: what the mod changes, what installing it
needs, who made which part. The `description` field in the details document is the one line a
mod's card carries. Neither is derived from the other, because a field derived from prose
rewrites itself whenever the prose is edited, and the two texts then disagree with nothing on
screen saying which is current.

A new project is written the display name as a heading and nothing else. A project that
already exists is never written to, and a git import keeps whatever the repository holds.

### Two routes

The project row opens it, beside the other routes that belong to the whole project. The
details document's description field carries one line naming `README.md` as where the long
text lives, with a control that opens the same document, because a creator filling in the
blurb is the one who has not met the readme yet.

The content tree draws no row for it. The file sits above `content/`, which is the only tree
the editor has.

### The document

Raw Markdown on the left, rendered Markdown on the right, half and half, with a divider the
creator drags. Below 560px, the width the ignore rules document folds its syntax rail at, one
half is on screen at a time and the toolbar carries a Raw and Preview toggle.

The halves scroll independently. Tying them together needs a map from a source line to the
node it drew, which the renderer does not give up cheaply, and a sync that holds for prose but
not for a table reads worse than none.

The rendered half is GitHub Flavoured Markdown, which is what a mod's readme is written for.
Raw HTML and inline scripts are not rendered: a readme arrives from a git import or a packaged
mod as readily as from the project's own author, and the webview runs with the app's
privileges. A relative image resolves against the project root, a remote image does not load,
and an external link opens in the system browser.

It autosaves, following the Ignore rules and Strings documents, so the tab's dirty state is
reserved for a save that is blocked or failed.

**Insert template** appends the sections the file lacks - About, Installing, Credits - matched
on heading text rather than heading level. It is an action and never fires on its own, because
a skeleton written at creation ships its empty headings to every player of a mod whose author
never opened the document.

A project with no readme draws a card offering to write one, which writes the heading and
nothing else when it is taken.

### A text document sits on the ground

Every document whose body is text a creator edits - the readme, its rendered half, the ignore
rules and its syntax rail - draws on `surface-950` with no padding around it and no inset frame
of its own. The tab is the frame, and what divides two halves is a hairline.

A bordered, rounded box inset in a padded document is a frame drawn inside a frame, which costs
a text surface the width it exists to give, and which reads as a card in a place where nothing
is being lifted off the page.

### What a save guards

A creator writes prose in a real editor as readily as in this one. A save carries the
modification time and size the buffer was read at, and a file that no longer matches refuses
the write rather than winning the race. The strip under the buffer names the file and offers
Reload, which takes what is on disk, and Keep mine, which writes over it. Nothing autosaves
again until one of them is pressed.

A file whose bytes are not UTF-8 opens read-only and says so. The packer moves those bytes
without decoding them, and a document that decoded to show them would re-encode them on the
next save.

A file's own line ending survives a save. A buffer arrives from a textarea with `\n`
whatever the file had, so rewriting every line of a CRLF readme is a diff its author did not
make.

### What Pack reports

A project with no readme is a pre-flight warning, in the shape the missing thumbnail warning
takes, and the pack goes ahead because a creator may mean it. A readme that exists is not
judged: nothing here can tell a deliberate one-line readme from an abandoned one.

There is no problems rule. The problems pass is about a project that will misbehave in the
game, and a missing readme cannot break anything.

### The license

The same command reads and writes the project's license file, which `ltk_mod_project` resolves
as `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md` or `LICENSE.txt` without regard to case, and which both pack
formats carry the same way they carry the readme. No route opens it yet. The document kind
names the file rather than taking a path, so a license surface is a route and a hue rather
than a second document.

## The explorers

Three views in the editor read a tree of files: the layer file tree, the root game browser and
a scoped game browser. Each of them is a tree and nothing else. A modder who knows the name of
the file they want is served. A modder who would know the texture on sight is not.

This section gives all three one set of controls: a location, a breadcrumb over it, a second
view that draws tiles, the sorting and filtering that a list of files asks for, and one
selection under every view.

### Three explorers, one set of controls

| Explorer     | Source                          | Reads                       | A row carries                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Layer files  | one layer of the project        | every entry, in one payload | a relative path, a size, a kind    |
| Game index   | the folded index of the install | one directory at a time     | a path, a size, a hash, an archive |
| Game archive | one archive of the install      | its whole chunk table       | the same                           |

Everything below is a view over rows that a source already returns. The thumbnail is the one
addition that reaches the backend, and it is a parameter on a URL that exists.

**The two game explorers hold these controls today.** The layer file tree keeps the tree it
has, because it lives in a side panel and the panel's own width is the question that decides
what a bar there can carry. Nothing in the model is theirs: a source answers a listing, a
location names a directory of it, and a third source joins by answering the same two.

### The location

A tree has no current directory. A grid needs one, because a grid draws one directory rather
than a hierarchy. The location is that directory: a path inside the explorer's source, where
the root is the empty path.

| Gesture                                    | The location becomes        |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| A click on a crumb                         | the crumb's directory       |
| A double click on a directory, in the grid | that directory              |
| The up control, `Alt+↑` or `Backspace`     | the parent                  |
| A focused row, in the tree                 | the directory that holds it |
| A reveal request                           | the directory of the path   |
| A path typed into the bar                  | whatever it names           |

In tree mode the location follows the focus and drives the breadcrumb alone. In grid mode it is
what the grid lists. A switch from the tree to the grid opens the grid where the tree was, and a
switch back expands to that directory and reveals it. This is what makes the two views one
explorer rather than two.

The tree half of that is open. A tree row taking the focus does not move the location today, so a
switch to the grid opens where the grid was last rather than where the tree is, and a switch back
expands nothing. The location, the filter and the selection already cross the switch, so this is
the one thread that does not.

### The explorer bar

```

| Box        | Narrows the rows, or searches. `Ctrl+F` and `/` focus it    |

| Options    | The sort, the kind filter, the item size and the thumbnails |

**The location leads, and what the source holds follows underneath.**
[Document chrome](#document-chrome) gives a document a row across the top of its surface, and an
explorer draws two of them in it. The first is the location and the box, which read as one line:
where I am, and what I am looking for inside it. The second is what the source contributes - the
file counts, the archives list, the rebuild, the ways out of an archive - and how the rows draw.

**Neither line has width it can give up.** A crumb trail folds away the moment it shares a row
with a count, a segmented control and a 288px box, and a folded trail is the one control here
that stops answering the question it exists for. The location is read on every move where the
rest is set once, so the location is what gets the first row rather than the leftovers of one.

- The scope sits **inside the box's own shell** rather than beside it, because the two are one
  question: a reader asking where this searches is looking at the box when they ask it
- The sort, the kind filter, the unnamed switch, the item size and the thumbnail switch are
  **one popover**. The item size is the tile's width in the grid and the row's height in the
  details list, and each view shows its own. What stays outside is the view toggle alone, because
  it changes what the reader is looking at where the rest only tune it
- The trigger tints while a filter is narrowing the rows, which is what says so now that no chip
  does. **There are no filter chips.** A row of them cost the location more width than the
  reading was worth, and the popover lists the same filters with a clear beside them

A side panel is narrower than a surface. There the bar keeps the up control, the last two crumbs
and the box, and folds the rest into the options. That variant arrives with the layer explorer,
which is the first panel to draw one.

### The breadcrumb

- The first crumb names the source: the layer's display name, `Game`, or the archive's file name
- Each later crumb is one path segment. A folded chain of single-child directories draws one
  crumb for each of its segments, because a crumb is a place a user lands on and the fold would
  hide those places
- The caret after a crumb is the separator, and it lists the directories that crumb holds, so a
  move from `skins/base` to `skins/skin01` costs one click and does not go up first. A source
  is asked for that listing when the caret opens, and never for the whole trail at once
- The leading crumbs collapse into one `…` crumb with a menu past four of them. The bar never
  wraps to a second line
- The last crumb reads as the location

`Breadcrumb` in `@/components` is the component. [The project bar](#the-project-bar) wants the
same shape for its `Workshop /` crumb, so one component serves both and neither module writes
the markup itself.

Two of these are still open. The collapse counts crumbs where the rule above measures width,
which is the cheaper reading of the same intent and is wrong on a trail of four long names. A
crumb carries no context menu, so **Copy path** and **Copy into the layer** are reached from a
row rather than from a crumb, and the last crumb carries no count of what it holds.

#### The path input

A click on the empty space after the last crumb, or `Ctrl+L`, turns the bar into a text input
holding the location. `Enter` navigates, and `Escape` returns the crumbs.

This is the cheapest route the game browser has. A `.bin` file names
`assets/characters/aatrox/skins/base/aatrox_base_tx_cm.dds`, and a modder holding that string
wants the directory it names rather than eight expand clicks through an index of 60,151
directories. The input completes the segment being typed against the children of the directory
before it, which the index answers in 30 microseconds.

A path that names nothing reports so in place of the rows. The view does not empty itself,
because an empty view reads as an empty directory and a typo is not one.

The report is still open. A path the source does not hold navigates and draws an empty
directory today, which is exactly the reading the rule above rejects.

### The views

| Mode    | Draws                              | Suits                                  |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Tree    | the hierarchy, as today            | reading the shape of a layer           |
| Grid    | one directory as tiles             | recognising an asset by its picture    |
| Details | one directory as rows with columns | sorting by size, and reading the facts |

Tree is the default, and it is the mode a side panel opens in. The mode is remembered for the
editor surface and for the side panel apart, because a 280px panel and a 900px surface do not
want the same view.

All three are built, and `Ctrl+1`, `Ctrl+2` and `Ctrl+3` reach them. The mode is one setting
across every explorer rather than one per host: the panel is a layer explorer question and
arrives with it.

The grid and the details list read one directory and differ in how a row draws, so one
component reads the source for both and the scroll, the virtualizer, the keys, the hit testing
and the context menu are one implementation under either. A second implementation of those is
a second keyboard model that drifts from the first.

#### The grid

```

- A directory tile draws a folder glyph and its file count, and the directories come first
- A file tile draws its thumbnail where a viewer produces one, and its kind glyph where none
  does
- The kind sits as a badge on a tile that carries a thumbnail, so a `.tex` and a `.dds` of the
  same art still read apart
- A name wraps to three lines and is then cut in the middle, which is the run Windows gives one.
  Both halves are kept because a game file differs from its neighbour at the end of the name as
  often as at the start
- The size reads under the name, and drops out at the two smallest tile sizes
- A texture with alpha draws on the checkerboard the preview already offers, under the
  `previewCheckered` setting that governs the preview
- The grid virtualizes one row of tiles at a time

**The name steps up the type scale with the tile.** A tile spans 64px to 256px and no one tier
reads well across that: the tier that suits the smallest is lost on the largest.

| Tile     | Name tier   |
| -------- | ----------- |
| 64, 96   | `text-fine` |
| 128, 160 | `text-meta` |
| 192, 256 | `text-row`  |

`text-fine` is a third dense tier, minted under `text-meta` for this. The size line reads at the
name's own tier at the plain weight, so the two hold their proportion at every tile size and the
hierarchy between them comes from weight rather than from size.

A row's height is computed from that choice rather than measured, so every part of a tile that is
not the art is a number the grid knows: its padding, its gaps, the tier's leading and the lines
reserved. A line the tile draws and the grid does not count is a row of tiles drawn over the row
below it, which is a bug this shape is chosen to make impossible.

The tile size is a slider in the options, on the ruler variant that the library's card size uses,
over 64, 96, 128, 160, 192 and 256 pixels. The six are not evenly spaced, so a thumb between two
of them takes the nearer: `w` stays one of six widths whatever the slider lands on. `Ctrl` and
the wheel, `Ctrl+=` and `Ctrl+-` are not built.

#### Thumbnails

The pixels arrive the way a preview's pixels arrive. The `ltk-asset` scheme renders any asset
the backend has a viewer for, so a tile is an `<img>` at that URL and nothing crosses the
JavaScript heap.

The URL gains one parameter.

```
ltk-asset://localhost/<token>?w=128
```

| Concern                 | The answer                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The decode              | The smallest mipmap that is still at least `w` wide                       |
| A texture with no chain | Level 0, and the `<img>` scales it                                        |
| A PNG or a JPEG         | Passes through untouched, as it does today                                |
| A kind with no viewer   | Is never asked for. The tile reads the kind off the extension first       |
| The value of `w`        | One of the tile sizes, so the slider asks for six widths and not for many |
| The store               | None. The response keeps `no-store`, so a scroll back up decodes again    |

`Texture::decode_mipmap` takes the level, and both containers hold their chain, so a 1024px
`.tex` at `w=128` decodes 128×128 and reads a sixty-fourth of the block data. This is what makes
a screen of tiles affordable at all, because a full decode for each tile is the work of sixty
open previews.

The [bin editor's texture swatch](BIN_EDITOR.md#a-wad-chunk-link) is the second reader of `w`,
at the row's own height, and its hover card the third at 256. Both sit under the same queue.

**What the queue is for.** The scheme is served over `http://ltk-asset.localhost` on Windows, so
the webview caps itself at six connections to that host and the preview of the open tab would
queue behind a screen of thumbnails. The frontend holds its own queue instead, and decides what
goes first.

- A tile asks when it mounts, and the virtualizer mounts one row beyond the viewport
- Nothing is asked for until the scroll has been still for 120ms, which is the debounce the
  project bar uses for the same reason
- A tile that scrolls away drops its `<img>`, which cancels the request in flight
- Six in flight, and one slot is held for whatever a preview tab asks for
- The queue orders by archive. A directory of the folded index draws its files from many
  archives and [the mount cache](#how-a-preview-reaches-the-screen) holds four, so an unordered
  screen of tiles evicts a mount that the next tile wants

The last rule is the one worth a measurement. Raising the mount capacity is the other answer to
it, and it costs a chunk table for each archive it adds.

#### Thumbnails in the tree

The tree has its own Thumbnails switch in the options, off by default. The grid's switch is on by
default and does not reach the tree, because a tree with thumbnails holds a fraction of the rows
it holds without them.

On, every row of the tree takes one height, set on a slider over 20, 26, 32, 48 and 64 pixels, 48
by default. The directories take it too: the virtualizer and the pinned band place rows at one
fixed height. A file the backend has a viewer for draws its asset where the kind glyph was, any
other file draws its glyph in the same box, and a directory draws the folder the grid draws.

| Shape    | The plate                                                    | The slot           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Square   | the art's box, the image fitted inside it                    | the box            |
| Original | the image's own ratio once it lands, from half to twice wide | twice the box wide |

Square is the default. The slot is a fixed column in both shapes, so every name in the tree starts
on one edge whatever its plate's width, and an original plate sits at the slot's leading edge.
Before the image lands its ratio is unknown, so the plate draws square until then.

The art is inset 4px, as in the details list, and is asked for at the smallest tile size the slot
fits in: `w=64` for a square at every height, and up to `w=128` for an original ratio at 64px.
That keeps `w` to the six widths of the grid.

#### The details list

```
| Name                                    Size      Kind    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| [D] Characters                      12 files   Folder     |
| [#] smolder_base_tx.dds               1.2 MB   DDS Texture|
| [#] smolder_emissive.tex               512 KB  Riot Texture|
| [#] smolder_recall.anm                 2.1 MB  Animation  |
```

Name, size and kind as columns, and modified where the source reports one. A game chunk carries
no time at all, so that column is absent in the two game explorers rather than empty in them.

**A directory reads what it holds in the size column,** the count the grid tile draws under its
folder, because no source totals the bytes below one and a blank cell in a size column reads as
a size of zero. Its kind column reads `Folder`.

The constraints are the ones that
[Why the file tree is not a table](#why-the-file-tree-is-not-a-table) already sets: one
`grid-template-columns` for the header row and every data row, a fixed row height for the
virtualizer, and a drop to the name and the size below a pane width of 640px. A header cell
sorts, and a second click on it flips the direction.

`@/components/DataTable` is the wrong host for it. That component mounts every row, and one
directory of the game index holds thousands.

**A row height is a setting, on six stops from 20px to 64px.** It is the list's answer to the
grid's tile size and it is its own setting rather than that one, because the two answer
different questions: how big the art is, and how many rows fit. 24px is the default and about
thirty rows on a 720px surface.

| Row  | Art  | The name reads in |
| ---- | ---- | ----------------- |
| 20px | 16px | `text-meta`       |
| 24px | 20px | `text-row`        |
| 28px | 24px | `text-row`        |
| 36px | 32px | `text-row`        |
| 48px | 44px | `text-row`        |
| 64px | 60px | `text-row`        |

The art is inset 4px inside the row, and the name drops a tier under 24px, where the body size
does not fit its own leading. Above that the name holds `text-row`: a taller row is asking for
bigger art, not bigger type.

**The art is asked for at `w=64` at every height,** the smallest tile size, so the list adds no
seventh width to the six that a session asks the
[asset scheme](#the-thumbnail-and-the-w-parameter) for. The tallest row still draws under that
width, which is what fixes the top stop at 64px. The same Thumbnails switch turns the art into
the kind glyph, and the `.tex` and `.dds` badge that a tile draws is absent here, because the
kind column already says which one a row is.

**The header row is sticky inside the scroll rather than fixed above it,** so the header and the
rows measure against one width and a scrollbar cannot slide them apart.

#### The column boundaries

A hairline sits on each fixed column's leading edge, and it is both the separator a reader sees
and the grab area. It thickens to the accent under the pointer and while it is held.

| Gesture      | Does                                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Drag         | Moves the boundary, between 56px and 280px              |
| Double click | Returns that column to its default width                |
| `Tab`        | Reaches it, and the accent says which one has the focus |
| `←` `→`      | Moves it 8px, so a boundary is settable without a mouse |

**The boundary follows the pointer, and the column to its right is what changes.** The name
takes whatever the fixed columns leave, so a fixed column's trailing edge cannot move: dragging
a boundary left widens the column after it and narrows the name.

**The drag is carried on the window rather than on a pointer capture.** Writing a width
re-renders the header under the pointer, and a capture is one more thing that has to survive
that for the boundary to keep following. The cursor comes from the document for the same
reason, because the pointer leaves the 12px grab area long before the drag ends.

### Sorting

Each Game index and WAD tab owns its sort field and direction. The sidebar has separate ordering.
A tab's sort survives a remount during the session and applies to every directory and view in that
tab. Changing it does not change another tab or the sidebar. A restart restores name order.

| Field    | Reads                                       | Available in       |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Name     | the label, in natural order                 | every explorer     |
| Size     | the file's size                             | every explorer     |
| Kind     | the file kind, and the name inside one kind | every explorer     |
| Modified | a time that no content scan reports yet     | the layer explorer |

- Directories sort before the files whatever the field is. An explorer that mixed the two would
  hide a directory behind a thousand files
- A directory sorts by the total below it once [Size](#size) supplies that total. Until then the
  size field orders the files and leaves the directories in name order
- Names sort in natural order, so `mip2` comes before `mip10`. Game file names carry numbers
- A sort applies to the whole explorer and not to the open directory alone, so a tree sorted by
  size is sorted by size at every depth

Nothing here reaches the backend. The layer explorer holds every entry already, and the game
index answers one directory at a time, so a sort reads rows that the frontend holds either way.

The control is the shape the library's sort already draws: the fields as toggle pills, and the
direction as a button that names what the current direction means. Both sit in
[the explorer bar](#the-explorer-bar)'s options, and clicking the active field flips the
direction as well, so the button states the direction rather than being the only way to it.

### Filtering

Three filters, and a row shows when it passes all three.

| Filter | Control              | Matches                                            |
| ------ | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Text   | the box in the bar   | the name, and the path once the depth is below     |
| Kind   | a menu of the groups | the file kind, which a row already carries         |
| Extra  | the same menu        | one condition that the source makes worth offering |

**A scope control says what the box reads.** One box carries two questions - narrow what is in
front of me, and find it anywhere in this source - and a box whose meaning followed the view
would give the same keystroke two answers with nothing on screen saying which. So the control
sits inside the box and names the scope in the source's own word: **This folder**, or **Whole
game** and **Whole archive**.

| Scope         | In the game index                            | In a game archive                   |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| This folder   | narrows the rows on screen, live             | the same                            |
| Whole game    | the find the index ranks, over every archive | -                                   |
| Whole archive | -                                            | every file below the location, flat |

The two sources differ because a read below the location differs in cost. An archive hands over
its whole chunk table, so widening the box costs nothing and its wide form is a flat list of
every file under the location that matches. The root game browser holds one directory and Rust
holds the rest, so its wide form is the find that
[The scan of the game](#the-scan-of-the-game) builds, and it answers over the whole install
rather than under the location. Narrowing that find to a prefix arrives with the scorer, and the
flat game grid with it - each tile carrying its path in dim text under the name.

**The scope is a grid question.** A tree draws the depth a flat list of hits cannot, so the box
narrows the tree whatever the scope says: the tree it leaves is the one
[Search](#search) describes, with every parent of a match kept. What the tree cannot do is answer
for a directory nobody opened, since it holds only what has been read - which is the whole reason
the game index keeps a scope that reaches past it.

The layer explorer keeps the widening to every layer, in the box's own menu. A relative path is
the same string in every layer, so a result names the layer that holds it.

**The kind groups.** These use the file kind that the backend reports, and a game explorer reads
it off the extension the way its row glyph already does.

| Group      | Kinds                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Textures   | `texture`, `texture_dds`, `png`, `jpeg`, `tga`, `svg`                                                  |
| Meshes     | `simple_skin`, `static_mesh_ascii`, `static_mesh_binary`, `map_geometry`, `world_geometry`, `skeleton` |
| Animations | `animation`                                                                                            |
| Data       | `property_bin`, `property_bin_override`, `riot_string_table`, `preload`, `lua_obj`, `light_grid`       |
| Audio      | `wwise_bank`, `wwise_package`                                                                          |
| Other      | `unknown`                                                                                              |

**The extra condition** differs by source, and each one is a single switch.

| Explorer     | Condition        | Answers                                               |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Game index   | Unnamed only     | Which chunks no hash table names, after a game patch  |
| Game archive | The same         | The same, for one archive                             |
| Layer files  | In another layer | Which files of this layer another layer holds as well |

An active filter tints the options trigger, and the popover that opens holds the filters with a
clear beside them. [The explorer bar](#the-explorer-bar) says why they are not chips in the row.

**The kind and the extra belong to the two item views, and the text is every view's.** The
whole-game tree holds the directories a user has opened and no others, so a kind filter there
would hide rows it never read and read as an answer about the install. The control says so
rather than offering what it cannot mean. The grid and the details list each draw one whole
directory, so neither has that problem. The text is different in kind: narrowing what is on
screen is honest about being that, where a kind filter would read as a claim about the source.

**A filter never hides a directory.** The kind and the extra apply to files alone, because a
directory row is the only way down into the location an item view draws and a filter that took
the folders away would leave that location a dead end. The text filter is the exception and matches a directory name
too, since a name is what a reader types to find one.

### Selection

Every explorer holds a selection, and the selection belongs to the explorer and not to the view
that draws it. A tree, a grid and a details list are three drawings of one set of items, and a
user who selects four textures in the grid and switches to the tree to read where they sit
keeps the four. The same holds for a view nobody has built yet. A tree held a focused row and
nothing else until the copy that the game browser exists for asked for more than one file at a
time.

**The model.** One set of item ids and one anchor, in one hook that every view mounts and no
view writes for itself. An id is what the source names an item by: a file's path hash, or a
directory's path. Those ids hold across a sort, a filter, a search and a view switch, which is
what lets the selection outlive all four. The model offers select, toggle, extend, select all
and clear, and it answers the count, the size and the targets a copy takes. No view reads the
set to decide anything. A view asks the model.

| Gesture                | Does                                                     |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| A click                | Selects one, and drops the rest                          |
| `Ctrl` and a click     | Adds one, or removes one                                 |
| `Shift` and a click    | Extends from the anchor, over every item between the two |
| `Shift` and an arrow   | The same, along the order the view walks                 |
| `Ctrl+Space`           | Adds the focused item, or removes it                     |
| `Ctrl+A`               | Selects every item in the directory that holds the focus |
| `Escape`               | Clears the selection                                     |
| A double click         | Opens a file, and descends into a directory in the grid  |
| A right click          | Selects the item alone, unless the selection holds it    |
| A move of the focus    | Moves the ring, and writes nothing                       |
| A move of the location | Drops the selection                                      |

The gestures are the same in every view. What differs is what "between" and "the directory that
holds the focus" mean, and the view answers both.

**The focus and the selection are two marks, and only one of them a click writes.** A row taking
the focus - by an arrow, by a click landing on it, by the view restoring it - moves the ring and
leaves the set alone. Writing the set from the focus instead collapses a `Shift` run the moment
the focus lands at its end, and drops a built selection on a plain arrow, so the two are two
callbacks and not one.

**A move of the location drops the selection**, the way a file manager does. Descending into a
directory that is itself selected would otherwise draw every item inside it covered, which reads
as though the move had selected them.

**A directory's caret is its own target.** Clicking it opens the directory and writes nothing,
where clicking the row selects it. One target doing both means expanding a folder also selects
every file below it, which is what selecting a folder means here and is not what opening one
should say.

**What a view supplies.** Three answers, and nothing else.

| The view gives             | In the tree                              | In the grid and the list       |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| The visible order          | the flattened rows, whatever their depth | the tiles or rows, in the sort |
| The focused item           | the focused row                          | the focused tile or row        |
| The directory of the focus | the focused row's parent                 | the location                   |

A range therefore runs over the rows on screen between the anchor and the click in the tree,
whatever their depth, which is what Visual Studio Code's explorer does, and over the tiles in
reading order in the grid. Under a filter, the directory that holds the focus is the filtered
set, so `Ctrl+A` selects what the filter shows.

The third row is the one still open. `Ctrl+A` takes every item the view is drawing rather than
the directory of the focus, which is the same answer in a grid - the location is what it draws -
and a wider one in a tree, where it reaches every expanded depth at once.

**A selected directory is every file below it.** That is the whole answer to what a selection
that spans depths means, and it holds in every view: a directory tile in the grid selects the
same files as the directory row in the tree. A copy of it writes the files below it, and a
count of it counts them. The copy writes each file once, whatever selected items cover it.

The root game browser holds a collapsed directory's listing only once it opens, and a selection
of that directory loads nothing. The backend walks the directory when the copy runs, because the
index holds the files and the frontend does not.

**What a view draws.** The model names three states for an item, and every view draws them with
the same two marks: a fill for the set, and a ring for the focus.

| State    | Means                               | Drawn as                  |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Selected | the set holds the item              | the accent fill           |
| Covered  | a selected directory holds the item | the fill at half strength |
| Focused  | the keys act here                   | the ring                  |

A row's fill is its band and a tile's fill is its background, and the two read as one system.
Covered is what makes the reach of a selected directory visible without a count, in the tiles and
rows inside it once the grid or the list descends. The game and LCU trees do not draw it: an open
directory's covered rows would fill the whole subtree below a single click, so the tree marks
depth with its guides instead.

**The tree's guides mark the depth the focus is in,** as the bin tree's do. Each ancestor level
draws a guide under that ancestor's caret, so a directory's guides join into one edge down every
row it holds. The guide of the directory holding the focused row takes the accent, and the guide
of the directory holding the row under the pointer lifts a rung. The focus and the selection are
two marks, and an item can hold one without the other, which is what an arrow key without
`Shift` moves. Every view sets `aria-multiselectable`, and `aria-selected` reports the selection
and not the focus.

**The bar.** The toolbar row states the selection at its right end, where the match count sits:
the file count, the size, the explorer's action where it has one, and a clear control after
them. The bar is the explorer's and sits above whichever view is showing, so a view switch does
not move it. An empty selection shows nothing there, so the row reads as it does today. A
directory's size needs a total on each directory entry, which the game index computes at the
build beside the file count it keeps already.

The action is not in it yet. The readout is the count, the size and the clear, and every route
out of a selection is the context menu or a key. What the action would name is the same **Copy
into base** that menu already carries, so the gap costs a gesture rather than a capability.

Until it does, a selection holding a directory reads its size as a floor - `3.4 MB+` - because
the bytes counted are the files' own and the directories add only their counts. That is the one
honest reading of a total nothing holds, and the `+` goes when the index carries one.

The context menu acts on the selection in every view, so **Copy into base** writes every
selected file whether the menu opened on a row or on a tile. That is the gesture that turns a
screen of thumbnails, or a tree of rows, into a layer. [Copy into a layer](#copy-into-a-layer)
holds the rest. `Ctrl+E` and `Ctrl+I` take the selection on the same rule, and the extract's
plural targets already carried it.

**Two surfaces hold no selection.** The search-result tree is an answer to one question rather
than a place, and the copy it feeds is taken where the files live, so a hit there focuses and
opens and nothing more. The layer file tree joins when it becomes an explorer.

### An item is a drag source

Every item of an explorer drags, in every view, and the drop target decides what the drop
means. A surface opens it, and a layer takes a copy of it. The item carries one payload
wherever it goes, so a target never asks which view or which explorer it came from.

**The payload.** The model's item list: for each item its source, its id, its kind and its
name. A drag that starts on a selected item carries the selection, and a drag on any other
item carries that item alone, under the rule the context menu obeys. A target derives what it
needs: a surface builds a preview reference for each file, and a layer copy builds its
targets. Neither reads the view.

| Dropped on                         | Does                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| A tab strip                        | Opens each file there, at the index, as a tab drag lands |
| The centre of a surface            | Opens each file there, at the end of the strip           |
| An edge of a surface               | Splits there, and opens each file in the new group       |
| A layer row of the Content section | Copies into that layer                                   |
| The layer explorer                 | Copies into the layer it shows                           |

The first three are the zones that [a tab drag](#a-tab-drag-creates-a-panel) has already, and
an item lands on them with one difference: a tab moves and an item opens. The last two are
new, and [Copy into a layer](#copy-into-a-layer) says what the copy writes.

- A drop names the group, so the rule that puts a preview in a group of its own does not apply
- A drag is a deliberate open, so it adds a tab whatever the tab open mode says, the way a
  double click on a replaceable tab keeps it
- Each file opens as its own tab, in the order dragged, and the first takes the focus. A drop
  of many files opens many tabs, which is what a user asked for by dragging many
- A file that is open already activates its tab, the rule every open obeys
- A directory dropped on a surface opens nothing. A directory is a place and not a document,
  and the surface paints no preview for it, the way it paints none for a split the resolver
  refuses. Its files still drop on a layer

**The ghost.** The kind glyph and the name for one item, and the count for more, the way a
file manager draws it. A layer row under the pointer lights and names the copy,
`Copy into base`, and the layer explorer lights whole, on the overlay the WAD drop draws
already.

**One context.** The editor's one `DndContext` sits at the grid's root today and never wraps a
side panel, so the sidebar's layer reorder does not nest inside it. An item drag starts in a
document and ends on a layer row, or starts in a side panel that hosts a browser and ends on
a surface, so the context climbs to the content browser's root and wraps both. The layer
reorder joins it as a sortable, and the collision rank tells a layer row under an item apart
from a layer row under a layer. The activation distance stays, so a click on an item is still
a click.

**The keys exist already.** `Enter` opens, `Ctrl+Enter` opens beside, and `Ctrl+C` then
`Ctrl+V` copies, so the drag adds no reach that a keyboard lacks.

A layer file is the same draggable, and a drop of one on a surface opens it the same way. A
drop of one on another layer is a later pass, once the layer explorer takes the selection.

### Keys

| Key                  | Does                                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl+L`             | Turns the breadcrumb into the path input       |
| `Alt+↑`              | Goes to the parent                             |
| `Backspace`          | The same, while no input holds the focus       |
| `Ctrl+F`, `/`        | Focuses the box                                |
| `Ctrl+1` `2` `3`     | Tree, grid, details                            |
| `Ctrl+=` `Ctrl+-`    | Steps the tile size                            |
| `Ctrl` and a wheel   | The same                                       |
| The arrows           | Move the focus, by a column where a view wraps |
| `Shift` and an arrow | Extends the selection along that order         |
| `Ctrl+A`             | Selects every item the view is drawing         |
| `Ctrl+Space`         | Adds the focused item, or removes it           |
| `Escape`             | Clears the selection                           |
| A letter             | Jumps to the next name that starts with it     |
| `Enter`              | Opens, and descends into a directory           |
| `Ctrl+C`             | Copies the selection, in a game explorer       |
| `Ctrl+V`             | Writes the copied files into the layer         |
| `Ctrl+E`             | Extracts the selection, `Shift` for the dialog |
| `Ctrl+I`             | Copies the selection into the layer            |

`Alt+←` stays with [the navigation history](#the-navigation-history), and `Alt+↑` is its own key.
A move to a parent is not a move back: going up is a move like any other, and it pushes a stop
rather than walking one.

**Every move of the location is a stop.** Descending into a directory, going up, landing on a
crumb, typing a path - the arrows walk all of them, so a reader who went four directories deep
gets back out the way they came. [Workshop](WORKSHOP.md#the-navigation-history) holds the shape
of the stack, since it is the shell's rather than the editor's.

A back that only changes the directory names that directory on the arrow, where a back that
changes the tab names the tab. Several directories share one tab, and its title alone would not
say which of them the arrow is going to.

Three of these are unbuilt. `Ctrl+=`, `Ctrl+-` and a `Ctrl` wheel wait on a keyboard route to
the tile size, which the options' slider is the only way to today. `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+V` wait on
the game clipboard, which is a feature of its own rather than a key this one forgot.

`Backspace` reaches every view, and the rule that no input holds the focus is what the explorer
checks before it acts: the box takes the key as a character while it is being typed into, and
the rows take it as a move to the parent.

### Where the state lives

| State                   | Belongs to                     | Because                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| The view mode           | the app, per host              | a work habit, and a panel and a surface differ        |
| The tile size           | the app                        | a work habit                                          |
| Thumbnails on or off    | the app                        | a work habit, and a modder on a laptop turns them off |
| The tree's thumbnails   | the app                        | the same, with its own row height and shape           |
| The sort                | the tab, within its project    | each tab answers its own question                     |
| The location            | the document                   | it is where the user left the project                 |
| The expansion           | the document                   | the same, and the trees hold it already               |
| The filter and the text | the document, and not the file | it answers one question and is gone by the next open  |
| The selection           | the document, for the session  | it feeds one copy, and a restart has no copy pending  |
| The copied files        | the app, for the session       | a copy in one project pastes into another             |
| The conflict answer     | the app                        | a work habit, and the dialog's checkbox writes it     |

`workshopLayout` holds the application preferences, beside the alpha checkerboard and the tab open
mode that it holds now. A preview's zoom and pan are in neither. They belong to one open preview
and go when it closes, which [Panning and zooming a preview](#panning-and-zooming-a-preview)
gives the reason for.

**The explorer's own three sit in a session store, not in `.ltk/editor.json`.** The location,
the filter and the selection are keyed by an explorer id - `game`, or `game-wad:<name>` - in the
store that already holds the browser's expansion and its scroll, for the reason that store
gives: the first preview a row opens splits a group off beside it, and a leaf that gains a split
around it remounts everything under it. A document holding its own location would land back at
the root on the very double click that opened the file. What that costs is a restart, which
forgets where each explorer was. Writing the location through to the file is what the rule above
asks for and is still open.

The layer file tree of the side panel is not a document either, so its location joins the
collapse state that the workshop store already keys by layer.

### Accessibility

- The grid is `role="grid"` over `role="row"` and `role="gridcell"`, and the tree keeps
  `role="tree"`
- The breadcrumb is a `nav` labelled `Location` over an ordered list, and the last crumb carries
  `aria-current="page"`
- A thumbnail is `alt=""`. The tile's name is the label, and a second reading of it is noise
- The grid holds one tab stop and moves a roving focus, the rule that the trees obey
- Every drop has a key: `Enter` opens, `Ctrl+Enter` opens beside, and `Ctrl+C` then `Ctrl+V`
  copies

### What ships in what order

| Step | Holds                                                                  | Status  |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| 1    | The bar, the location, the breadcrumb and the path input, in tree mode | Landed  |
| 2    | The grid, the tile size, the thumbnail switch, and the `w` parameter   | Landed  |
| 3    | The sort, and the kind filter with a way to clear it                   | Landed  |
| 4    | The details list, its sorting header and its resizable columns         | Landed  |
| 5    | The recursive filter of the game index                                 | Remains |
| 6    | The layer file tree as the third explorer, in the side panel           | Remains |

Step 1 changed no backend. Step 2 changed no backend either, because the `w` parameter and the
queue behind it landed with [the bin editor's texture swatch](BIN_EDITOR.md#a-wad-chunk-link)
and the tiles are its second reader. Steps 3 and 4 change none either, and step 4 asks the asset
scheme for no width the grid does not already ask for. Step 5 waits on the scorer that
[the project bar](#the-project-bar) builds. Step 6 is what the fold of the bar into a 280px
panel is for.

The selection is not in this table. It shipped with steps 1 to 3 rather than ahead of them, in
both views at once, under the order that [Copy into a layer](#copy-into-a-layer) sets, because
the copy wants it.

Five smaller pieces remain inside the landed steps, and each is noted where it belongs above.

| Open                             | Costs                                                |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| A directory's size total         | the bar reads a selection's size as a floor          |
| The game index's recursive box   | its wide scope answers the install, not the location |
| The location following the tree  | a view switch opens where that view was last         |
| An action in the selection bar   | a copy is one gesture further away                   |
| `Ctrl+A` scoped to the directory | it takes every depth a tree has open                 |

None of them blocks another, and the first is the only one that reaches the backend.

## Editor surface

The tab row works like the tab row in Visual Studio Code and has the same purpose. A tab is
one open document. The active document fills the surface below the row.

- Every open document stays mounted. A scroll position and a half typed edit survive a trip
  to another tab
- A document with unsaved edits shows a dot in place of its close button
- A close on a document with unsaved edits asks first, and the question offers **Save**,
  **Discard** and **Cancel**. Read [The unsaved-edits question](#the-unsaved-edits-question)
- The tab strip keeps its state per project, so a return to a project restores the documents
- Deleting a layer closes every tab that layer opened: its file tree, its locales and every
  preview of one of its files, in whichever group each one sits in
- The focused group answers the editor's keys. Read [The editor's keys](#the-editors-keys)
- A closed tab comes back. Read [Reopening a closed tab](#reopening-a-closed-tab)
- A strip too full for its width lists what it holds. Read
  [A full strip lists its tabs](#a-full-strip-lists-its-tabs)

The first visit opens the details document when the project still carries every default
from the scaffold. In every other case the first visit selects the first layer.

### The editor's keys

The focused group answers these and the other groups leave them alone. A key pressed while
the palette, a dialog or a menu stands over the editor belongs to whatever is on top.

| Key                | Does                                                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl+W`           | Closes the active tab, through the unsaved-edits question |
| `Ctrl+Shift+T`     | Reopens the newest closed tab                             |
| `Ctrl+Tab`         | Next tab, wrapping at the end                             |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`   | Previous tab, wrapping at the start                       |
| `Ctrl+PageDown`    | Next tab                                                  |
| `Ctrl+PageUp`      | Previous tab                                              |
| `Alt+1` to `Alt+8` | The tab at that position in the strip                     |
| `Alt+9`            | The last tab, whatever the strip holds                    |
| `Ctrl+S`           | Writes the active document now                            |
| `Ctrl+F`           | Finds inside the active document                          |

`Alt` rather than `Ctrl` for a tab by index, because `Ctrl+1`, `Ctrl+2` and `Ctrl+3` route to
home, mods and workshop. Visual Studio Code on Windows binds a tab by index to `Alt` as well,
so the keys a reader brings from it are the keys they get here.

**`Ctrl+S`** writes whatever the active document holds. A document that autosaves writes what
its debounce still owes, and its save status reads saving and then clean. Mod details runs the
same save as its button. A document that offers no write of its own - a game browser, a
preview - answers with nothing, and reports nothing broken.

**`Ctrl+F`** goes to the box the active document carries. The game index, a game archive, the
WADs list, the objects browser and the problems list each have one, and a text document opens
its own find bar. A bin or an object tab has no box, so the key opens the palette in its `@`
scope, which reads the rows of that tab. A document with neither leaves the key alone.

A walk with nothing open goes nowhere, and an index past the end of the strip takes no tab.

### Reopening a closed tab

`Ctrl+Shift+T` puts the newest closed tab back, and a run of presses walks back through the
closed tabs newest first. **Reopen the closed tab** in the palette's View group runs the same
thing, and reads its reason while nothing is closed.

- A tab lands in the group it was closed from, and in the focused group where a prune took
  that group with the tab
- It comes back permanent, whatever role it held, and takes back the pin it led its strip with
- A batch close records its tabs in strip order, so a run of reopens rebuilds the strip
- The list holds the last twenty closed tabs of each project of the session, and a walk to
  another project and back keeps them
- A layer delete takes its documents with the layer. Its file tree, its locales and every
  preview of its files have nothing left to read, so none of them comes back
- A replaced ephemeral tab is not a closed tab. A walk through a tree replaces one per row,
  and a list of those is a list of rows nobody asked to keep

The list is session-only, the way the navigation history is. `.ltk/editor.json` holds where a
user left a project, not what they closed on the way there.

### Finding text in a document

The readme, the license and the ignore rules each answer a find bar of their own, opened by
`Ctrl+F` and closed by `Escape`, which hands the caret back to the text.

- The field holds the query and reads `1 of 4` beside it, or `No results` for a query the
  text does not hold
- `Enter` and the next control walk the matches forward, `Shift+Enter` and the previous
  control walk back. Both wrap
- Every match is marked in the text, and the one the bar sits on is marked apart from the
  rest, selected in the buffer and scrolled to
- The query outlives a close of the bar and a trip to another tab, so reopening the bar
  searches for whatever was searched for last
- A find asked for while a readme too narrow for both halves is showing its rendered half
  brings the raw text back, because the matches are in the text

A match is painted by a copy of the text laid under the buffer, because a textarea cannot
mark a range inside itself. Both layers carry the same padding and wrapping and scroll as
one.

Replace is out of scope. These files are edited by hand, and a replace is a second decision.

### A full strip lists its tabs

A control at the trailing edge of the strip, left of the lock, opens the whole list of that
group's tabs in strip order. It carries the number of tabs the lane does not hold whole, and
it stands only while that number is above zero.

- A row carries the tab's glyph, its title, its context and the dot a dirty tab carries, and
  the active row rises off the popup the way the active tab rises off the strip
- Picking a row activates that tab, which scrolls it into view
- Each row carries its own close, which runs the strip's own guarded close
- The list belongs to one group. A split draws one control per strip, each over its own tabs

The count comes from the laid-out boxes rather than from the tab count. A pin, a long title
and the lock each count for the width they take. A tab the lane cuts in half counts as off
screen.

### Document chrome

A document's own controls - a save, a filter, an import - sit at the trailing edge of the
tab row that holds its tab, and show while that document is active. A leaf draws one row
and not two. A second bar under the tabs costs every leaf 36px to repeat the title its tab
already carries, and a split of three leaves pays that three times over.

The [explorer bar](#the-explorer-bar) is the one exception, and it is a document's own row
rather than a second title. It carries the location, which a tab cannot hold, and it takes
in the controls that the explorers keep in the tab row today.

A control that answers for the whole view stays out of the tab row, because a tab row per
leaf means one copy of it per leaf. The layout control sits in the project header and the
route to the game index sits in the primary panel's project row, so each has one copy
whatever the grid holds.

### Tab titles across layers

A change of the selected layer leaves every open tab alone. A user compares two layers, and
a strip that empties itself at each layer change makes that work impossible.

A file name is therefore not unique in the strip. Two layers hold the same relative path,
and two tabs then carry the same title.

- A title is the file name alone while it is unique in the strip
- The layer joins the title as a dim field after it as soon as a second tab takes the same
  name
- The layer part returns to hidden when the other tab closes

The tab already carries a dim context field after the title, and the strings document
already fills it with a layer name. The rule above sets when that field shows.

A document's label names its layer in a field of its own, apart from the context field. The
strip fills the context from the layer field only for a title a second open tab takes. The
comparison spans every group of the project rather than one strip. A split holds two strips a
user reads at once.

A context a document sets itself stands whatever else is open: an archive on a game chunk's
preview, a declaring file on an object, a path on a nested rules file. Those name something
other than a layer.

### Document types today

| Document     | Content                                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Mod details  | The project metadata form                          |
| Layer files  | The file tree of one layer                         |
| Strings      | The override table for one layer and locale        |
| Readme       | The project's `README.md`, raw beside rendered     |
| Ignore rules | The project's `.modignore` as text                 |
| Game index   | Every archive of the install, folded into one tree |
| Game WADs    | The list of the install's archives                 |
| Game archive | The file tree of one archive of the install        |
| Preview      | One asset, drawn by the viewer its file kind has   |
| Bin          | A `.bin` as blocks over its parsed tree            |
| Object       | One declaration of an object, from depth zero      |

### Planned document types

| Document     | Content                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Mesh preview | A model in a small viewport                                  |
| Objects      | Every object of the install, folded into one tree over paths |
| References   | The objects declaring a class, or linking to an object       |

The bin document is its own kind, and [Bin editor](BIN_EDITOR.md) specifies it. It reads a bin
rather than an image and edits one where the source allows a write, and neither fits a variant
on `Preview`. The object document is a second kind over the same held tree, keyed on a
declaration, per ADR-0028. The objects browser and the References document are specified
[below](#objects-browser).

The mesh preview joins the preview document rather than adding one of its own. A viewer is a
variant on the backend's `Preview` and an arm of the switch the preview document draws, so
the tab, the document and the reference behind them are unchanged.

### How a preview reaches the screen

The pixels do not cross IPC. The backend registers an `ltk-asset` URI scheme, renders the
asset into something the webview decodes, and the viewer draws an `<img>` at that URL. A
base64 result would arrive as a string for the frontend to reassemble into a canvas, where
this way the webview's own decoder does the work and the bytes never reach the JavaScript
heap.

An asset reference says where the bytes live, and it has three forms: a file of a layer, a
chunk of one of the install's archives, and any file on disk. A new store is a fourth form
and reaches every viewer at once.

What an `<img>` cannot report — the container, the block format, the mipmap count — comes
over IPC beside it, and the preview's status strip shows it. That payload is what the
inspector's **Texture facts** row reads when it arrives.

Reading a chunk mounts its archive, and a mount reads that archive's whole chunk table. A
bounded cache keeps the last four mounts, so one preview after another out of one archive
pays for the table once. A refresh of the game index drops them, because asking for a fresh
index is the one signal the app gets that the install changed underneath it.

The image preview decodes DDS and TEX through the `ltk_texture` crate. The `ltk-tex-utils`
repository holds an integration to work from.

### Files the webview reads

The League client ships web content, and the game ships a few web files of its own. The
preview draws them with what the webview already holds rather than a viewer per format.

| Files                                                | Viewer                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SVG, GIF, WebP, BMP, ICO                             | The image preview, which zooms and pans them as any image     |
| webm, mp4, ogg, wav, mp3                             | The webview's `<video>` or `<audio>`, which starts on a click |
| JSON, JS, CSS, HTML, XML, YAML, Markdown, plain text | A read-only CodeMirror view, highlighted and searchable       |
| OTF, TTF                                             | A sample at a ladder of sizes, which the reader can retype    |

- The extension picks the viewer. A chunk no hash table names reaches the image preview, which
  reads a web image off its bytes
- A file arrives over the `ltk-asset` scheme as its own bytes, under the media type its
  signature names. Every response carries `nosniff` and a policy that runs nothing, so an
  HTML page or an SVG is never run as a page
- An HTML page, a script and a stylesheet show as source. JSON opens indented, because the
  client ships it on one line, and **Format** turns that off
- The text view decodes the first 4 MB. Save a copy reaches the rest
- `Ctrl+F` over a text preview opens the view's own search

### A layer file saved from outside

A modder edits a texture of the open project in another program and saves it. Every preview of
that file redraws without a reopen: the particle viewport, the skin and material viewports, the
graph's file nodes, the explorer tiles, the texture swatches and the open preview tab.

| Part           | Behaviour                                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The watch      | `content/` of each open project, recursive, from mount to unmount        |
| The debounce   | A path counts after 300 ms without events, and a write in progress waits |
| The event      | `layer-files-changed`, the project and each file as its layer and path   |
| The version    | A count per file, which a preview URL carries as `v`                     |
| A page reload  | Drops every watch, and the new page acquires new ones                    |
| The app's save | Arrives the same way, and redraws the same previews                      |

An editor's save is a burst: a temporary file, a remove and a rename over the file. The
debounce reads the burst as one change. An event names a file the way a layer asset reference
names it, and the frontend matches it without a lookup.

Only a changed file takes a new URL, and every other URL is unchanged. The scheme answers
`no-store` and the backend reads the file for each request. The URL is the only cache key.
The asset info of a changed file refetches, and the status strip reads the new header.

A particle slot draws the old texture until the new one lands. The run keeps its clock: the
warm-up pause covers the first load of a viewport and no reload. The preview tab keeps its zoom
and its pan across a save of the same file.

A mesh, a skeleton and a clip do not reload. Their buffers come from queries keyed by the asset
rather than by the URL.

### Panning and zooming a preview

A modder reads a texture at two distances. First they check the silhouette at the size the
game draws it. Then they read one edge at the texel. Every image and vector preview answers
both. `react-zoom-pan-pinch` supplies the wheel, the drag, the pinch and the double click.

| Gesture                 | Does                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| The wheel               | Zooms about the pointer, a tenth to the notch        |
| A trackpad pinch        | The same, by as far as the fingers moved             |
| A drag                  | Pans, at every zoom and in every direction           |
| A double click          | Doubles the zoom, about the pointer                  |
| The strip's `−` and `+` | Steps the zoom by a quarter, about the pane's center |
| The strip's percentage  | Goes to the actual size, and centers                 |
| The strip's **Fit**     | Goes back to the whole image, and centers            |

**A drag always pans.** No bounds hold the image inside the pane and no edge pulls it back. A
modder moves a fitted icon aside as readily as a corner of a 4096 pixel texture.

Bounds lock a fitted image in the middle of the pane. Most textures a modder opens do fit, so
the drag would do nothing for most of them. A viewer that does not answer a drag reads as a
viewer that cannot pan. The pane carries the grab cursor for the same reason. The drag is
there whatever is on screen, so the cursor says so whatever is on screen.

An image can leave the pane that way. **Fit** and the percentage both center what they scale,
and either one returns it in a single click.

The zoom reaches from 5% to 3200%. Past 100% the image draws nearest neighbour, so a modder
reads the texels rather than the webview's guess at what is between them. Under 100% the
webview smooths as it would anywhere else.

The alpha checkerboard holds its 16 pixel square at every zoom, because a checkerboard that
scales with the image stops reading as a ground.

A fit is only ever a reduction. An icon smaller than the pane reads at its own size. To fill
the pane with it would show a modder texels of the webview's own invention before they asked
for any.

**The zoom and the pan belong to one preview.** A file opens on its whole image. The zoom of
the last file does not reach it.

An earlier version shared one zoom across every open preview, on the argument that four
textures compared beside each other want one scale. That argument does not survive the next
open. A 3200% read of one texture is then what the next texture opens at. The image is another
size, and the scale says nothing about that. Every preview still shares the alpha
checkerboard, because that is a display preference and not a viewport.

The strip's controls follow the same split. `−` and `+` are the library's own step, which
zooms about the middle of what is on screen and leaves the pan alone. The percentage and
**Fit** name one scale outright, so they move the transform and center what they scaled.

The library adds its wheel step to the scale and does not multiply by it. One fixed step is
then a nudge at 3200% and a leap at 5%. The step is a share of the current scale for that
reason, which turns the sum back into a ratio at every zoom.

### How a file opens

A single click on a tree row opens it in the group's one replaceable tab, and a double click
keeps what it opened. The next click then takes a fresh replaceable tab beside the kept one, so
a reader walks a directory in one tab and keeps the files worth keeping as they go. The row's
context menu offers **Open** for a tab of its own.

The cost a click used to carry is what the replaceable tab answers: a walk through a tree
loads one file at a time and leaves one tab behind, whatever it passed through.

**Preview on a single click** in the Project editor settings turns it off, and a click then
selects the row alone while a double click opens a tab of its own.

A click carrying `Ctrl`, `Shift` or `Cmd` in a grid or a details list is a click about the
selection, so it opens nothing.

### Preview tabs

A scan of a large layer opens one tab for each file that a user looks at. The strip then
holds more tabs than a user can read, and the user closes them by hand.

The replaceable tab is the answer, and **Preview on a single click** in the settings holds the
choice. On, a click reuses one tab and a double click keeps it. Off, every open adds a tab, so
four textures compared against each other are four tabs.

A replaceable tab shows its name in italic, and a double click on the tab itself keeps it.
A pin keeps it too, per [A pinned tab](#a-pinned-tab). A double click on a kept tab maximizes
its panel, per [Maximizing a panel](#maximizing-a-panel).

**Each editor group holds its own replaceable tab.** A walk through a tree in one group
replaces that group's tab and leaves every other group standing, so a split holds as many
replaceable tabs as it holds groups. A reader comparing a texture in one group against a tree
in another keeps the texture.

A gesture that places a tab keeps it. A drag into another group and a split with the tab both
say the document is worth keeping, so both make it permanent. A reorder inside one strip
leaves the role alone, because the tab did not go anywhere. A group that gives up its
replaceable tab holds none until its next open.

### What a tab's context menu holds

- **Close**, **Close Others**, **Close to the Right**, **Close All** - scoped to the strip
  the tab sits in, so the other group of a split keeps its own tabs
- **Copy Path**, **Copy Name** - the path is whatever addresses the subject outside the app:
  a file's path on disk, and for a game chunk its archive and then the path inside it
- **Reveal in Files**, on a file tab - the browser the file came from, scrolled to its row.
  Read [Reveal in Files](#reveal-in-files)
- **Pin**, and **Unpin** while it is pinned - the tab itself, at the top of the menu. Read
  [A pinned tab](#a-pinned-tab)
- **Split Right**, **Split Down** - already there, now under the same menu
- **Lock Group**, and **Unlock Group** while it is locked - the group the tab sits in. Read
  [A locked group](#a-locked-group)

Closing several tabs at once asks the unsaved-edits question once for each editor that has
any. The clean ones close straight away and the rest queue behind one dialog, so a refusal
answers for the whole batch.

### Reveal in Files

A file tab's menu opens the browser the file came from and lands on its row, the way an
object tab's menu opens the objects. A layer file opens that layer's files, reopens every
directory shut above the row and scrolls to it. A game chunk shows the game files, reads the
directories down to the chunk and selects it, and a chunk no hash table names lands in the
unnamed group. The tree's filter is cleared, because a row it hides is a reveal that lands on
nothing. A file picked off disk belongs to no browser here, so its tab carries no such item.

### The unsaved-edits question

The question offers three answers, in the shape Visual Studio Code uses.

- **Save** writes the document and then closes it. A write that fails leaves the tab open,
  reports what stopped it, and drops the rest of the queue
- **Discard** closes the document and stands the next question up
- **Cancel** leaves every queued document open. One refusal answers for the batch

**Save** shows for a document that holds its edits until it is asked. Mod details is the one
such document, and every other editable document autosaves. A document that writes on its own
offers Discard and Cancel alone.

The document a question is about is the document on screen behind it. A batch close activates
each queued document as its own question opens, so the surface always shows what is being
answered for.

A close request made while a question stands joins the queue rather than replacing it, and a
request naming a document already queued changes nothing.

### Quitting with unsaved edits

Closing the application asks before it closes while any document holds unsaved edits. The
question names how many, and offers the same three answers as a per-tab close, with **Save
all** in place of Save.

A pending autosave is written before the question is asked. A document mid-debounce reaches
its file, and the question names only the documents that hold their edits until a save.

A document that holds unsaved edits and offers no save of its own keeps the window open under
**Save all**, and the report names how many wait on a tab of their own.

### Where a preview opens

Every preview opens as a tab, in the group beside the one that asked for it. A group with no
neighbour splits one off to its right, and a group that is empty takes the preview instead of
splitting, since one half of that split would show nothing. The browser keeps its own group
either way, so a walk through a tree never pushes the tree off screen.

A group already showing a preview takes the next one, which is what keeps a walk continued
from the preview itself out of the browser's strip. A locked group takes neither, and the
preview goes to the group beside it.

Nothing else moves. A document opened from the sidebar lands in the focused group, as
before, and a preview dragged out of the group settles wherever it is dropped - the group
is where a preview _opens_, not a place it is held to. A locked group takes neither the
first preview nor a later one. Read [A locked group](#a-locked-group).

The layer tree keeps its own panel, so the tree and the preview are both on screen at all
times. A separate preview pane at the right edge adds nothing.

### Bin files and the extension

For a `.bin` file the manager has a second route. It can open the file in Visual Studio
Code and let the ritobin-lsp extension supply the syntax and the diagnostics.

The two routes answer different needs. The preview answers "what is in this file?" in one
click. The extension answers "I want to edit this file" with a full editor.

## Game browser

A mod replaces a file that the game already holds. To replace one, a modder must find the
file, read its path and copy it into a layer. The editor gives no route to that work
today, so the modder opens a separate WAD unpacker and returns with a file and a path.

The game browser removes that trip. It reads the WAD archives of the installed game and
shows every file of the game in one tree.

### Requirements

- A modder finds a game file without a second application
- A copy into a layer lands at the path that the game reads
- The first open is quick, and every open after it is quicker
- A game patch costs a rebuild of the changed archives alone
- A modder extracts a file, a directory or an archive to disk, under the rules wadtools set

### Where it opens

The game browser opens as a tab in the editor surface. It is also a
[panel type](#panel-types), so a user can put it in a side panel instead. A user opens more
than one browser at a time. Read [Scope to one archive](#scope-to-one-archive).

The primary panel's project row carries the route to the root browser, beside the mod
details, so it stays on screen whatever the grid holds and whichever sections are
collapsed. The empty editor offers the same route as a button, and a row of the WADs
section opens a scoped browser for the archive it names.

A tab is the right default, and the layer file tree keeps its side panel. The two views
differ in four ways.

| Question                     | Layer file tree   | Game browser          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| How long does it stay open?  | The whole session | One search            |
| How much width does it need? | A side panel      | The editor surface    |
| How many files does it hold? | Hundreds          | More than one million |
| What does a row open?        | A document        | A preview             |

The layer file tree is navigation for the current work, so it holds a panel for the whole
session. The game browser is a reference. A user opens it for one question, copies the
answer into a layer and closes it again.

### The list of archives

The **Game WADs** document names every archive the install holds, and a row opens a
[scoped browser](#scope-to-one-archive) for that archive.

It answers the question the folded tree cannot. The root browser merges the archives away
on purpose, so a modder who wants `Aatrox.wad.client` itself needs a list of archives, and
this is that list. The route to it is a control in the root browser's own chrome, because
the fold is what creates the need for it.

- A filter box narrows the list from the tab row, and matches the whole relative name, so
  `champions/aa` narrows as well as `aatrox`
- A row leads with the archive's file name, which is what a modder searches by, and the
  directory under `DATA/FINAL` follows it in dim text
- The rows virtualize, because an install carries hundreds of archives
- A row whose tab is the active document carries the accent, the rule the side panel's
  lists obey

A tab and not a side panel section: the list is a reference a user opens for one search
and closes again, which is the same reason the game browser is a tab. The side panel
answers to the selected layer, and an install's archives answer to nothing in the project.

### Scope to one archive

A modder works on one champion, and one champion is one archive. The whole game is the
wrong view for that work. A filter is the wrong control for it too, because a filter holds
one value and a modder compares two archives.

The view therefore has two forms. The **root browser** shows the whole game as one tree,
with no archive in it. A **scoped browser** shows one archive and nothing else.

- A user opens as many scoped browsers as the work needs
- A scoped browser carries the archive name as its tab title
- One archive opens one tab. A second request activates the tab that is already open

Two routes open a scoped browser, and both are lists of archives.

| Route                               | Result                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| An archive row of the WADs section  | A tab for an archive that the selected layer changes |
| An archive row of the Game WADs tab | A tab for any archive the install holds              |

The first route is the one that pays. The WADs section already names the archives that the
layer changes, so one click moves the modder from "this layer changes `Aatrox.wad.client`"
to "here is the rest of `Aatrox.wad.client`". The second covers the archive that no layer
touches yet.

The root browser carries neither route, because it folds its archives away.

A scope is a view over the index, and not a second index. A scoped browser reads the
entries that the index already holds for its archive, so a scope costs a filter and
nothing more.

The open browsers share the rest of the surface.

- Each browser holds its own scroll position and its own expansion, under the rule in
  [Editor surface](#editor-surface)
- The strip still holds one preview tab, so a preview from one browser replaces a preview
  from another
- A copy still writes into the selected layer, whichever browser starts it

A side panel hosts one browser. A user who wants two archives side by side drags one tab
onto a boundary, and the layout then holds two editor surfaces with one browser in each.
Read [A tab drag creates a panel](#a-tab-drag-creates-a-panel).

### The League client

The League client ships its own archives, the `*.wad` files under `Plugins`, and a modder who
themes the client looks for files in them the way a game modder does in the game's. The
**LCU index** and **LCU WADs** tabs read those archives with the same browser, list and scoped
tab as the game. The palette opens both, and the LCU index's archive control opens the list.

- A separate index, built at its first read and rebuilt from its own control. 46 archives
  and 61,436 files build in a third of a second
- Names come from the `lcu` hash table, which the shared cache already holds
- A row previews and extracts to a folder as a game row does. One folder per archive keeps
  the archive's whole path, because nearly every client archive is named `assets.wad`

The game reads no client file, and a client file is no part of a game mod. An LCU row
therefore offers no copy into a layer, no Find references and no Open in VS Code. The
palette's search, a path field's suggestions and the object index read the game index
alone, and a bin document refuses a client chunk.

### The tree

The tree has two levels.

1. The directory path, such as `assets/characters/aatrox`
2. The file

Neither level is an archive. The root browser folds every archive into one tree, and a
scoped browser holds the one its tab title already names.

A row shows the file name, an icon for the file type and the size in the archive. A run of
directories that each hold one directory folds into a single row, the rule the layer file
tree obeys. The tree uses the same row height, the same virtualizer and the same keyboard
rules as that tree, so a user who knows one view knows the other.

An archive holds no directory of its own. Each chunk carries one path hash, and a hash
table supplies the path. Read [Hash names](#hash-names). A chunk with no known path groups
under an `unknown` node, and its row shows the hash in hex.

Both browsers draw a grid over these same rows, and [The explorers](#the-explorers) is what
governs it: one location, one selection, one bar. This section describes what a row is, and
that section describes the ways to read a set of them.

### Search across the game

The box in [the explorer bar](#the-explorer-bar) is the search, and its scope control is what
widens it past the open directory. The box matches the full path, the same rule that the layer
file tree obeys. A scoped browser searches its own archive, and the root browser searches every
archive.

The game holds more than one million paths, so the root browser's wide search reads the index
and not the rendered tree. A result keeps its parent directories, so the result is still a tree.

An archive filter and a file type filter narrow the search further. Both reuse the
controls of the layer file tree.

### Preview

A click on a file opens it in a preview tab, under the rules in
[Preview tabs](#preview-tabs). The preview reads the chunk from the archive and shows it
with the viewer for its file type. The viewers are the ones that
[Planned document types](#planned-document-types) lists.

One set of viewers serves both trees. A texture of a layer and a texture of the game open
in the same viewer, so a modder compares the two with a switch between two tabs.

### Copy into a layer

The copy is the purpose of the whole view. The browser writes the selection into the
selected layer at the path that the game reads, so the path is correct by construction.
This removes the most common fault of a new mod.

- A copy of a file writes one file
- A copy of a directory writes every file below it, under the rule in
  [Selection](#selection)
- A copy writes each file once, whatever selected items cover it, and writes a shared chunk
  under one archive
- A target file that exists with other bytes asks first, unless a setting answers
- A file with an unknown path lands under its hash, in hex

**What is built.** The menu route, on one row or one directory, through the extractor
rather than a copy command of its own - the same write and the same target path, with
**Skip** for a file already there rather than the ask. The selection, the selection bar,
the clipboard and the drag wait on [the selection model](#selection).

The Content section of the primary side panel sets the target layer. This is the same
selection that the secondary side panel reads. A project with no layer disables the copy,
and the control says so.

The copy reads the targets of the [selection](#selection) and knows nothing of the view
that built it. A file target names its archive and its hash, a directory target names its
path, and the tree, the grid and the details list hand over the same list. A view that does
not exist yet hands over the same list too, which is the test the design has to pass.

#### The routes

One command, reached four ways. The menu is what a mouse finds, the bar is what a selection
shows, the keys are what a keyboard knows, and the drag is what a file manager taught. Each
route ends in the same write and the same report, and each one reads the model and not the
view, so a route that works on a row works on a tile.

**The context menu.** **Copy into base** acts on the selection, and names the target layer
in its label, so a user reads where the files go before the click. **Copy into…** lists the
other layers, for a file that belongs in a chroma and not in the base. A project with one
layer shows no submenu. The menu is one component, mounted by every view. A right click on
an item outside the selection selects that item alone first, the rule every file manager
obeys, so a user who right-clicks one file copies one file and a user who built a selection
keeps it.

**The selection bar.** The count and the size at the right of the toolbar row, then one
button that names the layer, **Copy into base**, with the other layers on its caret. This is
the shape the workshop's selection button draws already, and it is the route a user finds
once a selection exists and no menu is open. The scoped browser draws the toolbar row as
soon as a selection exists, and [the explorer bar](#the-explorer-bar) gives it one for good.

**The keys.** `Ctrl+C` in a game browser copies the selection, or the focused row when
nothing is selected, so the key never does nothing. `Ctrl+V` in the editor writes the copied
files into the layer that is selected at the paste. The editor's clipboard holds the files,
and a paste in a second project writes there, because the game is one and the clipboard is
the application's. `Ctrl+V` inside a text field pastes text, as it always did.

The same `Ctrl+C` writes the chunk paths to the system clipboard, one on each line. A modder
who copies a texture often pastes its path into a `.bin` next, and one gesture serves both
readers. **Copy Chunk Path** stays in the menu for the single row.

**The drag.** An [item is a drag source](#an-item-is-a-drag-source), and a layer is one of
its targets. A drag that starts on a selected item carries the selection, and a drag on any
other item carries that item alone, so a drag from a tile and a drag from a row drop the
same thing. It drops on a layer row of the Content section, or on the layer explorer
wherever that explorer is hosted and whatever view it draws. The explorer lights as one
target and not a row or a tile of it, on the overlay the WAD drop draws already, and the
overlay reads `Copy 12 files into base`.

A paste and a drop land at the game path whatever item of the layer explorer holds the focus
or the pointer. The path is not the user's to choose, which is the whole point of the copy.

#### The target path

A layer holds one directory for each archive it changes, named as the archive's file is
named, and the chunk path under it.

```
content/<layer>/<Archive>.wad.client/<chunk path>
```

| The chunk                         | Lands at                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| A named chunk of one archive      | `<archive>/<path>`                                     |
| A named chunk of several archives | The same, under the one archive the copy chooses       |
| An unnamed chunk                  | `<archive>/<hash>.<ext>`, the extension from the bytes |

The archive directory takes the archive's file name and not its directory under
`DATA/FINAL`, which is how the layer names its WADs already and what the WADs section reads.

The hex name loses nothing. The overlay builder reads a file stem of sixteen hex digits as
the chunk hash itself, and it reads the stem alone, so an extension beside it costs nothing
and gives the file a viewer. `LeagueFileKind::identify_from_bytes` in `ltk_file` names the
kind and `extension` names the suffix, which is how wadtools names a chunk it extracts and
how the preview names an unnamed chunk's kind already. A chunk that no sniff names keeps
`.bin`, which is the name `ltk_overlay` gives such a chunk itself.

#### A chunk in several archives

The index folds every archive into one tree, and a chunk that several archives carry is one
file in it. 939,329 chunks fold to 819,136 files, so about one chunk in eight has a second
copy somewhere in the install. A shared particle texture sits in a champion's archive and in
a map's.

**One file, one archive.** A copy writes a shared chunk once, under the archive the user
means, and never a duplicate. The mod does not need the second copy, and a layer that held
one would carry the game's own redundancy as its own weight.

The copy chooses the archive in this order, and stops at the first rule that answers.

| Rule | The archive                                 | Because                                                 |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | The scoped browser's own                    | The tab names it, and the scope is the user's statement |
| 2    | The only one, when one carries the chunk    | Seven chunks in eight                                   |
| 3    | One that the selected layer changes already | A modder at work on Aatrox keeps landing in Aatrox      |
| 4    | The one a segment of the path names         | `assets/characters/aatrox/…` names `Aatrox.wad.client`  |
| 5    | The user's pick, in the dialog              | Nothing else can answer                                 |

Rule 4 compares each segment of the path with each archive's file stem, without case. Rule 5
opens [the dialog](#the-dialog), and the select there starts on the archive that carries the
most files of the copy, so a batch from one champion lands in one place.

The index keeps the first archive of a chunk today and drops the rest. Rules 2 to 5 need
every one. A file that one archive carries costs what it costs now, and the 120,193 extra
copies cost a small integer each. `GameFileEntry` gains the list, and the row's tooltip and
the inspector read it.

#### The dialog

A copy runs without a dialog when nothing about it needs a decision, and one dialog carries
every decision it does need. Three things open it.

| Trigger                                     | The dialog shows                     |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| A file exists in the layer with other bytes | The list, and Skip or Replace        |
| A shared chunk that no rule places          | The archives, as a select            |
| More than 200 files or 256 MB               | The count, the size and the archives |

A file that exists in the layer with the same bytes is no decision. The game's copy and the
layer's copy are one file, so the copy leaves it and the report counts it as skipped. The
question is asked about a file the modder changed, which is the one file a replace can cost
them.

**The answer is a setting.** The Project editor section of the settings gains **When a
copied file exists**: Ask, Skip or Replace. Ask is the default. A checkbox in the dialog,
**Do this every time**, writes the other two, so a user meets the setting in the flow and
not in a settings page. The setting is the application's, beside the tab open mode.

Ask is the default because two flows pull the other way, and nothing in a copy says which
one is at work. A modder who edits in the layer wants Skip, because a replace loses the
edit. A modder who pulls the game's files again after a patch wants Replace, because the
edit is the thing to redo. Either sets the answer once and never sees the question again.

The dialog's buttons are **Copy** and **Cancel**. Cancel writes nothing. The frontend has the
count and the size from the rows before the plan returns, which is what the size on a
directory entry is for, so the summary draws at once and the rest fills in.

#### The commands

Two commands, because the dialog needs three answers before anything is written, and the
backend is the side that holds them.

`plan_game_copy` takes the project, the layer and the targets. It walks each directory
target, applies the archive rules, and compares each file that exists in the layer with the
chunk's bytes. It returns the count and the size, the archive of each file, the files that
need a pick with their candidates, and the files that exist with other bytes. It writes
nothing, and it reads only the files that exist in the layer, which are few.

`copy_game_files_to_layer` takes the same, with the picks and the conflict answer, `skip` or
`replace`. Each file writes to a temporary name and renames into place, the rule
`add_files_to_layer` obeys. A copy that fails part way keeps the files it wrote, because
each is whole on its own, and the report names the one that failed. The report holds what
was written, what was skipped, what was replaced, and the archives.

| Target      | Holds                                | Expands to                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| A file      | the archive and the path hash        | itself                             |
| A directory | an index path, and an archive or all | every file below it, in that scope |

The backend walks a directory, because the root browser never loaded its children. A copy
above the dialog's size line reports its progress, on the event shape the Fantome import
uses, and the toast holds the bar.

A target names its source the way an `AssetRef` does, so a later source copies through the
same two commands with one more variant: a mod package, a Fantome archive, a second install.
The views never learn which source they draw, and the copy never learns which view asked.

#### The report

- A toast: `Copied 12 files into base`, the archives in its description, and a **Show**
  action that reveals the first file in the layer tree
- The content tree refetches, so the layer tree and the WADs section show the new files
- The rows stay selected. A second layer takes the same files in two clicks, which is how a
  base and a chroma start

#### What ships in what order

| Step | Holds                                                                        |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | The model, its keys and its bar, in the tree. A size on a directory entry    |
| 2    | The commands, the menu, the bar's button, the dialog, its setting and report |
| 3    | `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+V`, with the paths on the system clipboard                |
| 4    | The held mark, and its switch                                                |
| 5    | The item drag, onto a surface to open and onto a layer to copy               |

Step 1 adds one field to one struct. Step 2 is the backend work, and it is where the index
starts to keep every archive of a chunk. Steps 3 to 5 change no backend. The tree is the
first view to mount the model because it is the view that exists. The grid and the details
list mount the same hook when they land, and none of the five steps waits on them. The layer
explorer takes the same model in a later pass, when a delete and a reveal give it an action
to act on.

### The held mark

An item of a game browser whose path the selected layer holds already draws a mark, and
`In base` on its tooltip. A directory draws it when any file below it does. Held is an item
state beside the three that [Selection](#selection) names, so each view draws it in its own
idiom: a dot in the accent before the size in the tree and the list, and a badge on the tile
in the grid.

This is the inverse of the inspector's **In the game archive** field, and it answers the
question that field cannot: which of the game's files does this mod change already? A
modder reads it across the whole game at one look, and a copy that would conflict is
visible before it starts.

No backend work. The content tree payload holds every path of the layer, and a set of those
paths, with the archive directory cut off, answers a row in constant time. The ancestors of
each path join the set once per layer, so a directory row answers the same way.

The mark follows the selected layer, so a switch in the Content section redraws it.
**In the layer**, a second switch in the kind menu of the two game explorers, narrows to the
marked rows. Read [Filtering](#filtering).

### Extract to disk

A modder does not always want a file in a mod. A texture goes to an image editor, a `.bin`
goes to ritobin, a mesh goes to a viewer, and a whole archive goes to a folder that other
tools read. The browser's second output is an extract to disk. It reads the same
selection, the same targets and the same directory walk as the copy, so a gesture that
copies is a gesture that extracts.

#### What extracts

| Gesture                                  | Extracts                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Extract…** on the selection            | every selected file, and every file below a selected directory |
| **Extract…** on a directory              | every file below it                                            |
| **Extract…** on an archive row           | the whole archive                                              |
| **Extract archive…** in a scoped browser | the same, from inside the archive                              |
| `Ctrl+E`                                 | the selection, or the focused item when nothing is selected    |

The item reads **Extract…** with the ellipsis, because a dialog follows. It sits under
**Copy into base** in the same menu, on a row, a tile or an archive row alike, in every
view. An archive row is a row of the Game WADs tab or of the WADs section, and both gain
the menu and a hover action for it.

The Game WADs list takes [the selection model](#selection) too, so a user selects three
archives and extracts them in one go. Each archive lands in a directory of its own name.

#### The dialog

One dialog, remembered field by field, so the second extract is two clicks.

| Field                     | Holds                                                  | Default              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Destination               | A folder, with a Browse button                         | the last folder used |
| Layout                    | **Keep paths** or **Flat**                             | Keep paths           |
| One folder per archive    | A switch. Adds `<Archive>.wad.client/` above each path | off                  |
| Existing files            | **Skip** or **Replace**                                | Skip                 |
| Open the folder when done | A switch                                               | on                   |

A summary line above the fields states the count, the size and the archives, from the same
plan the copy runs, so a user reads what a directory holds before the write starts.

**Keep paths** writes each file at its game path under the destination, which is what
wadtools does and what a repack needs. Two extracts into one folder merge into one mirror
of the game, and a modder builds that mirror over a month without a thought.

**Flat** writes every file into the destination by its name alone. A second file of the
same name takes its path hash before the extension, `aatrox_base_tx_cm.0123456789abcdef.tex`,
so nothing is lost and nothing is asked.

**One folder per archive** writes the layout a layer holds. A folder extracted with it
drops straight onto a layer through **Add WAD folder**, so an extract is also a way to
stage a layer outside the project.

The destination refuses a folder inside the League install. The manager never writes into
the game directory, and an extract is not the exception.

**The filter chips.** An extract writes what the explorer shows. A user who filtered the
tree to textures and extracts a directory gets its textures, and the dialog names the chips
in its summary, `Textures only`, with a control to lift them for this one extract. wadtools
has the same switch as `--filter-type`.

#### Without the dialog

A dialog per file is the price of the first extract, not of every one. Once a folder has
been picked, every menu that carries **Extract…** carries two items above it, and the
dialog moves to `Ctrl+Shift+E`. The three read the same on a file row, a directory row, an
archive row, a right click on the tab itself, and the row under an archive or a preview
tab, because each of those differs only in what the aim expands to.

- **Copy into `<layer>`**, `Ctrl+I`, writes the aim into the selected layer exactly as
  [Copy into a layer](#copy-into-a-layer) has it - at the game path under
  `<Archive>.wad.client/`, and never over a file already sitting there
- **Extract to `<folder>`**, `Ctrl+E`, writes the aim into the last folder used, on the
  answers the dialog last took

Neither is drawn where it has nowhere to go. Until a folder has been picked there is
nothing to repeat, so the quick item is absent and `Ctrl+E` opens the dialog instead, and
a project with no layer shows no copy.

`Ctrl+I` is an interim key. The design gives the direct copy none of its own, because
`Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+V` are its keyboard route, and the game clipboard is unbuilt - so
`Ctrl+C` stays free for it.

A preview tab offers the two, and not the dialog: **Save a copy…** is already the whole of
the dialog one file needs, since its save dialog names the file and picks the folder.

An extract runs alongside whatever comes next. The dialog shuts on **Extract**, and the
bar and its **Cancel** ride the toast, so a modder browses on while an archive is read.
One runs at a time, and a second request is answered rather than queued.

#### The rules

wadtools is the reference, and its rules are the crate's rules. Read
`crates/wadtools/src/extractor.rs` in `LeagueToolkit/wadtools` and
`crates/ltk_wad/src/extractor.rs` in `LeagueToolkit/league-toolkit`.

| Case                                  | The file is named                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| A resolved path                       | the path, as the hash table names it                       |
| An unresolved hash                    | `<hash>.<ext>`, the extension from the sniff               |
| A path with no extension              | `<stem>.ltk.<ext>`, or `<stem>.ltk` when no sniff names it |
| A path that collides with a directory | the same `.ltk` form                                       |
| A name too long for the file system   | `<hash>.<ext>`, in the destination root                    |

- A write is whole or absent. **Skip** opens the file with `create_new`, so an existing file
  is skipped without a race, and **Replace** writes over it. This is wadtools' `--overwrite`
  switch, and Skip is its default too
- A chunk is read once, raw, and decompressed on a worker, so the archive is read in order
  while the disk writes in parallel. A bounded channel between the two caps the memory, and
  this is the pipeline wadtools runs
- The report counts what was written, what was skipped, the bytes, and the files by kind,
  which is wadtools' `--stats`

#### The extractor lives in `ltk_wad`

Two copies of the rules exist today, one in `ltk_wad::WadExtractor` and one in wadtools'
own `Extractor`, and they agree line for line on the naming. The library copy extracts a
whole archive alone, in sequence, and always over an existing file. The tool's copy has
everything else, and nobody else can call it.

The manager needs the tool's copy as a library, so the default extractor in `ltk_wad` takes
what wadtools holds, and wadtools drops its own.

| The crate gains                           | Comes from                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| A chunk subset, and not the whole archive | new, for a selection        |
| The flat layout, with the hash suffix     | new                         |
| Skip or replace, through `create_new`     | wadtools                    |
| Bytes and by-kind counts in the result    | wadtools                    |
| The parallel reader and writer pipeline   | wadtools                    |
| A cancel flag the reader tests            | new, for the toast's Cancel |
| Names recovered from `.bin` files         | wadtools, on a byte scan    |

`PathResolver` stays the seam, and any `HashMap<WadHash, String>` is one. A resolver answers
`None` for a hash it has no name for, and the crate writes that chunk under its hash. The
manager's resolver is the game index itself, which resolved every path through the mimir
tables at the build, so the extractor asks nothing the index has not answered already.

**What the name recovery costs, measured.** The crate reads a bin's strings as the
length-prefixed runs the format writes, with no parse of the object tree, and it tells a
bin from any other chunk by its first block alone, through one zstd context kept for the
whole pass. Against wadtools' full parse on the same install, the names come out
identical: 2,600 for `Aatrox.wad.client` and 60,326 for `Global.wad.client`, with no hash
table at all. `Global` takes 1.5 seconds that way, where the full parse takes 3.7. With the
mimir tables synced, 18 chunks of 560,894 across 205 archives have no name, and no bin
names them, so the pass finds nothing and costs half a second on `Global`. The pass is for
the machine whose cache is not synced yet.

This is a change in `LeagueToolkit/league-toolkit`, and the manager's extract waits on it.
It sits on the `feat/wad-extractor` branch there, as PR #183 of four commits, and a release
remains. The third commit reshapes the API, since the release breaks it anyway. The
extractor holds one `&dyn PathResolver`, and closures for the path filter and the progress.
`extract_chunks` takes path hashes, and lists the ones the archive lacks. Progress reports
each chunk once it is done, and a failure names its chunk through `WadError::Chunk`. The
fourth commit keys every chunk by `ltk_hash::WadHash`, the type a `WadChunkLink` in a bin
already holds, so a link read out of a bin looks its chunk up with no conversion. The
manager drives `WadExtractor` for a WAD import today, with the resolver that names
nothing, so the crate is a dependency already and the upgrade is a version bump and two
call sites.

#### The command and the report

`extract_game_files` takes the targets, the destination, the layout, the per-archive
switch, the existing-files answer and the kind filter. It expands the targets as
`plan_game_copy` does, groups the chunks by archive, mounts each through the WAD cache,
and drives the extractor once per archive.

- A progress event carries the count done, the total, the bytes, and the current path, on
  the shape the Fantome import uses. The toast holds the bar and a **Cancel**
- A cancel stops the reader, and the files written so far stay, because each is whole
- The report: `Extracted 1,204 files (312 MB)`, the destination as its description, the
  kinds under it, and an **Open folder** action. The folder opens itself when the switch
  says so

A preview tab's context menu gains **Save a copy…**, which is this extract for one file
through a save dialog, so a modder who has the texture open does not go back to the tree
for it.

#### What ships in what order

| Step | Holds                                                                      |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | The crate: the subset, skip or replace, the stats, flat, the name recovery |
| 2    | The dialog and the command, on the selection and on a directory            |
| 3    | The archive rows, the Game WADs selection, and the scoped browser's action |
| 4    | The progress event, the cancel and the pipeline                            |
| 5    | `Ctrl+E`, **Save a copy…**, and the filter chips                           |

Step 1 is upstream. Steps 2 and 3 change the frontend and one command. Step 4 lands the
parallel pipeline in the crate and the cancel on both sides. The drag out of the window in
[Ideas for review](#ideas-for-review) is this extract with the desktop as the destination
and Flat as the layout.

### Hash names

A WAD archive stores a path hash and not a path, so the manager needs a hash table to show
a name.

The manager integrates the mimir shared cache for this. Read `LeagueToolkit/ltk-manager`
issue **#326**.

| Concern | What the mimir cache gives                                       |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Size    | The game table is about 38 MiB, against 198 MiB of text          |
| Load    | The reader maps the file and parses nothing                      |
| Memory  | Every tool on the machine shares one copy through the page cache |
| Miss    | A miss costs one binary search and reads no string data          |

The `ltk_mimir_cache` crate finds the shared cache directory, reads its manifest and opens
the active table. `HashStore::open_layered` opens the `Game` table and the `Lcu` table as
one reader, and `get_batch` resolves the chunk hashes of a whole archive in one call. The
crate ships no HTTP client, so the manager supplies the download with the client that it
already holds.

A Cache tab in the settings owns the table state. It shows each table's entry count and
size, syncs the cache from the mimir releases, and re-downloads every table when a user
forces it. An empty cache never blocks the browser - every row still shows its hash.

The manager downloads the CommunityDragon `hashes.rst.xxh3.txt` list today, for the string
override editor. The mimir cache publishes that list as its `RstXxh3` table, so a later
pass removes the second download.

### The game index

The index holds the chunk table of every archive under `DATA/FINAL`, recursed. The game
holds no archive outside that directory. The browser reads the index and never mounts an
archive to draw a row. The overlay builder reads the same index, because the game gets one
index and not two.

The manager builds it in memory at the first read of a session. A live install measures
456 archives and 939,329 chunks, and the build takes 1.3 seconds. A directory read from
the built index takes 30 microseconds.

- The build starts at the first read, and not at application start
- Nothing writes it to disk yet, so it costs those seconds once per session. The
  memory-mapped cache below is what makes it survive a restart
- A build reports no progress yet, and the browser holds a spinner while it runs
- A rebuild is a control in the browser, because the index is a snapshot of an install
  that a patch can change under it

#### One tree

A chunk that several archives carry is the same file in each, so the index keeps the first
copy it reads and drops the rest. The 939,329 chunks of a live install fold to 819,136
files under 60,151 directories, and no pair of duplicates disagrees about its size.

The browser therefore draws one tree over the whole game. A modder looks for
`assets/characters/aatrox`, and which archive carries it is the install's business.

That tree is too large to hold at once. Its paths alone are about 62MB of text, which is
more than an IPC message should carry and more than a rendered tree should hold, so the
index answers one directory at a time and the browser reads a directory the first time a
user opens it.

#### Invalidation

Only a change of the game invalidates the index. The overlay keeps its own state file for
the mod set and the mod content, and the index holds neither.

A WAD header carries an xxh3 checksum of the data of the archive. The checksum sits in a
fixed prefix of the file, so a validation pass reads a few hundred bytes for each archive
and never touches a chunk table.

1. Read the header of every archive under `DATA/FINAL`.
2. Compare each header checksum against the checksum in the cache.
3. Keep the entries of an archive whose checksum matches.
4. Read the chunk table of an archive whose checksum differs, and replace its entries.
5. Remove the entries of an archive that the game no longer holds.
6. Write the new cache.

A game patch changes a few archives, so step 4 rebuilds a few archives. An archive that
the cache does not name is a new archive, and step 4 covers it too.

A format version in the cache header forces a full rebuild. The overlay artifacts obey the
same rule for the same reason. An index that a new release builds differently is stale,
and no checksum reports that.

**`ltk_wad` exposes it.** `Wad::mount` reads the header checksum in the 0.5.4 the workspace
compiles, and `Wad::checksum()` returns it verbatim, so nothing upstream stands before this
step. A version 1 archive carries no checksum at all. The game ships version 3 archives, so
the index treats a missing checksum as a rebuild.

#### One cache, not two

`ltk_overlay::GameIndex` reads the same chunk tables today and writes its own
`game_index.bin`. Two caches over one set of bytes is one too many, so the memory-mapped
cache replaces it. The overlay builder and the game browser then read one file.

| Axis         | `game_index.bin` today         | The one cache                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Load         | MessagePack, and a full parse  | A map, and no parse            |
| Invalidation | One fingerprint for the game   | One checksum for each archive  |
| A game patch | Rebuilds every archive         | Rebuilds the changed archives  |
| A reinstall  | Rebuilds, because a time moved | Keeps, because the bytes match |
| Sizes        | Absent                         | Present, for the tree rows     |

The overlay reads the index by path hash, and the browser reads it by archive. One file
holds both directions, so neither reader builds a map at load.

**The whole-game fingerprint stays.** `OverlayState`, the incremental build and the per-mod
WAD reports each key on one `u64` for the game. The cache derives that value from the
archive checksums, in archive order, so every one of those readers keeps its current shape.
The value also improves. A checksum comes from the bytes and a file time does not, so a
reinstall of the same patch no longer forces a rebuild.

**Where the code lives.** `ltk_overlay` owns the game index, and the manager depends on
`ltk_overlay`. The cache therefore ships in the `LeagueToolkit/league-mod` workspace, and
the manager reads it through that crate. The manager builds no second index of its own.

## Objects browser

The game's content is objects with paths, and the [bin object index](#the-bin-object-index)
holds every declaration of the install. The project bar answers a query over it. The objects
browser is the browse over the same index: every object of the install, folded into one tree
over its paths, the way the [game browser](#game-browser) folds the archives into one tree over
theirs.

### Where it opens

A tab in the editor surface, and a panel type, under the game browser's rules. The primary
panel's project row carries the route beside the game browser's, and the empty editor offers
the same button.

Opening the view warms the index whether or not the Objects switch is on. The body draws the
build while it runs, with the archive count. The `$` source answers while the index is warm.
The empty state offers to keep the switch on.

### The tree

Two levels, as the game browser's tree has two: the path prefix, and the object.

```
│ ▾ Characters                                                       12,480 │

```

A node is a path. A prefix no object bears draws as a directory row with the count of objects
under it. A node that is an object draws its mark, its last segment, its class and its source.
The source is the declaring file's name, and its archive and folder are on hover. The last
segment and the file name are what a reader scans for, so a narrow panel takes its room from
the class first, dimmed beside them, and from the name last.
A node that is both an object and a prefix draws as one object row with a caret, its
descendants under it. A run of prefixes each holding one prefix folds into a single row, the
rule the layer tree obeys.

A prefix is read from the backend when it is first opened. Unnamed objects group under `?` and
read as hex. With no table naming a single object, the hint the game browser draws for the same
state draws here. The tree uses the same row height, the same virtualizer and the same keys as
the source tree.

### Object grid

Tree and Grid show the same object directory. A grid folder opens its prefix. Breadcrumbs
link every path segment, including folded prefixes, and Up opens the parent path. Tiles
default to 128 pixels wide. The view options popover contains tile size and the thumbnail switch.
Search shows matching objects as tiles. Reveal in Objects keeps the selected view. In Grid it
opens the parent and scrolls to the focused tile. In Tree it expands the ancestors and focuses
the row. View preferences survive editor layout remounts.

A tile has the explorer tile's layout: an art plate on the card surface, the name, and a second line with the
class, or with the object count for a folder. The name wraps to two lines and is cut in the
middle, because objects of one folder differ at the end of their names. The tile carries no
footer. An object with children carries a folder-and-count badge on its art. The badge is a
separate control that browses the children. The declaring file is in the tile's tooltip beside the path. A
tile without a still draws its kind glyph: a sparkle for a particle system, a figure for a
skin, a sphere for a material, and a cube for any other class.

Switching from Tree to Grid carries the selected folder into its own directory. A selected
object opens its parent grid and receives focus. A selected search hit stays in the search
results. With no selection, the grid keeps its last location. The grid writes the selection
back: a focused tile selects its node, and a folder the grid moves to becomes the
selection. Switching from Grid to Tree expands to the selection and focuses its row. A search
keeps its hits in place in both directions.

Thumbnails are on by default. Particle systems, skins and materials get small stills,
rendered as tiles enter view. A tile the pointer rests on for 400 milliseconds plays in
place: a particle system loops, a material turns on its sphere and a skin turns on a
turntable. The tile plays until the pointer leaves it. Keyboard focus plays nothing in the
tile, and a particle system the keyboard selection rests on opens as the preview tab, as
[What a row opens](#what-a-row-opens) describes.
A tile with a preview carries an expand button in its art's top right corner, shown while the
pointer rests on the tile, while the tile has focus, and while its popover is open. The button
opens the tile in a large anchored popover, and a second press, Escape or a press outside closes
it. Space does the same for the tile under the pointer, or the focused tile, and the button's
tooltip names the key. A click on the tile itself still opens the preview tab. The popover also
plays a particle system whose sample saw no burst, so the reader can watch it, and a burst it
shows becomes the tile's still. Reduced motion keeps the still on hover, and the button and
Space still play the large preview, because the reader requested it. Opening a tile uses the same first
declaration as the tree. Skin stills show the textured bind pose. Thumbnail cameras frame the
projected box with five percent padding, using the same aspect ratio as the tile artwork.
The preview canvas clears to the card surface, so a still and an empty plate share one
colour one surface rung above the page ground.

Skin captures wait two rendered frames after assets arrive, without a camera animation.
Particle warm-up samples the system in batches capped at eight steps or two milliseconds per
renderer per frame, and searches for the first drawn particle. A particle counts only when its
emitter draws in a preview with no character, so an emitter that only spawns children, or one
that draws the character it is attached to, counts for nothing. The search runs for at least
two seconds and at most ten, and for one second past the last emitter's start. A found burst
then settles until its oldest drawn particle is a third through its life, for at most 0.4
seconds, and the capture counts its two frames from the end of the sample. A system with no
drawn particle during its sample has no burst. A drained preview restarts after a
quarter-second pause once every emitter's start time has passed. A preview draws the scene's
depth pass whenever an emitter has a soft fade, as the object tab does, and resolves custom
materials through the bin the system is read from. Texture requests fetch a single 128-pixel
mip rather than a chain for each still.

A preview ends in one of three outcomes. A still replaces the glyph. Nothing to preview
keeps the glyph with no mark: a particle system with no emitters or no burst, a skin
without a mesh or a skeleton, a material with no translated pass and no texture on this
machine. A material with no translated pass draws its base texture on the lit sphere, or the
first texture its passes name. A failure keeps the glyph with a failure mark. A job fails after
fifteen seconds without progress, where progress is the bin opening and each asset load
landing, so a large particle system still loading its textures is not failed. A throw from the
simulation is a failure too. The toolbar counts the failures among the tiles on screen and
offers to render them again. A tile's context menu retries that tile alone when it failed or
when its particle system had no burst. Hovering a failed tile also tries it again. A save of a
bin drops the stills of its objects.

The objects document mounts two canvases above its grids, so a folder change, a search or a
hidden tab keeps them and their compiled shader programs. An idle canvas stops drawing rather than
unmounting. Only visible rows and one overscan row ask for stills, no new still starts
during a scroll, and a played tile takes priority. Stills are kept for the session under the
object, the project and the theme's ground, up to 512 of them. A still on screen is never
evicted. The bin each preview reads stays open for ten seconds after its last preview, up to
four bins, so objects of one file are parsed once. Previews draw at the display's pixel
ratio, up to two. Texture requests take 128-pixel mips with two loads per preview at a time,
and particles use a 4,096-particle root pool without seek checkpoints. Full geometry is still
required. A loading indicator marks active jobs. Hidden documents and background windows stop
preview work.

### A node with several declarations

A node's children belong to the path and not to any one file. A node one file declares carries
that file in its source cell. A node several files declare carries `n files` there, a chip that
lists the declaring files on hover and pins on a click. Each file in the list opens its own tab,
`Ctrl` beside. The node's row opens the first declaration in archive order, and its expansion
holds the path children alone.

A layer's declaration is one of the listed files, marked by its layer name the way the palette
marks a layer row. A node the install declares and a layer overrides carries the layer name on
the node row. A node only the project declares has no row. The tree's nodes are the install's.

### What a row opens

An object row opens its declaration as an [object tab](BIN_EDITOR.md#the-object-tab): a
preview on click, a pinned tab on double click, `Ctrl+Enter` beside. A directory row toggles on
click. A node that is both opens on click, and expands from its caret or the Right arrow alone.

The arrow keys, `Home` and `End` move the selection through the tree and the grid, and `Enter`
opens the selection as a click does. A particle system the keyboard selection rests on for
250 milliseconds opens as the preview tab, the way a click previews it, and focus stays in the
browser, so the next key keeps browsing. Other kinds of object open only on `Enter`. With
preview on click off, the keys only select. An open that splits the browser's group remounts
the browser, and the selection is revealed and focused again.

| Item              | Does                                               |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Open, Open beside | The object tab, in the focused group or beside it  |
| Show in file      | The declaring bin, scrolled to the object          |
| Copy path         | The object's path                                  |
| Copy hash         | The object's hash                                  |
| Copy class hash   | The class's hash, shown for a class no table names |

Copy into a layer and Extract stay on the file tab. A row here is an object, and an object row
writes no file.

### Search across the objects

The toolbar's box swaps the body for the tree of every hit under its real prefixes, expanded,
capped the way the game find is capped. The pattern is a substring or a regex over object paths,
with the `class:` term the palette takes. Ranking stays the palette's.

### Reveal in Objects

An object tab's menu and an object block's menu open the view, expand the object's path and
focus its row.

### The References document

One document, keyed the way Problems is. A new query replaces the last, and the query sits in
the header with a re-run control. Hits group by declaring file. A row of the index is one
object. A row of the walk is one place inside an object, its property path beside the object's
name, and it opens the object tab expanded down to that row.

| Query                             | Asked from                                  | Answered from       |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Every object of a class           | An object row, an object tab's kebab        | The index           |
| Every use of an embedded class    | An `embed` or `pointer` row                 | A walk of every bin |
| Every object linking to an object | Find references on every menu an object has | The same walk       |
| Every object naming a file        | A file row of the game tree or Content tree | The same walk       |

The walk reads the project's layers first, then the install's declaring files in archive
order, one job per archive on the bounded pool the problems pass uses. For an object, a `link`
and a `hash` value match, map keys included. For a file, a `hash` of its path, a `file` of its
chunk hash and a `string` of its path in any case match, and a chunk no table names is matched
by a `file` value alone. It runs on demand. A band under the header draws the bins read
and the references found, with a Cancel that stops the walk before its next bin, and a
cancelled walk keeps what it found and marks the header partial. The declaring files of an
object are no query of their own, because the object tab's `n files` chip lists them.

#### The walk, measured

Read on 2026-09-14 from the measurement test in `src-tauri`, on a release build over a live
install, on 8 workers, straight after the index build and so on a warm file cache.

| Measurement                            | Value                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Bins walked                            | 43,593                                     |
| Incoming links of one character record | 1,399ms, 51 references in 25 files         |
| Uses of `VfxEmitterDefinitionData`     | 1,513ms, 1,820,309 references, 20,000 kept |
| The walk, on a cold file cache         | Not measured                               |

**The walk stays a walk.** A second index behind the Objects switch saves a second and a half
per query, and it holds every link and every embedded class of the install, rebuilt on a game
patch and on every layer save. A query is a menu item asked once, with its progress and its
cancel on screen, so the second index is not built. The decision is open again if a cold file
cache puts the walk past ten seconds.

Find all references sits on the menu of every row that carries a
[class card](BIN_EDITOR.md#the-class-card), and on every menu an object has.

### Ideas

- A view scoped to one prefix, one tab per champion, opened from a prefix row. An archive is a
  real thing with a list behind it, and a prefix is a fold of the tree the view draws. It earns
  a tab when someone keeps one champion open all session and says so
- A grouping by class, beside the grouping by path

### What ships in what order

The reading track in [Bin editor](BIN_EDITOR.md#what-ships-in-what-order) holds the order. The
view is its step 5, the References document its step 6, the walk its step 8.

## The panel layout

The editor grid holds its surfaces in a tree of splits. A user drags a tab onto the edge
of a surface and gets a second surface there, side by side with the first.

### What the layout governs

Two systems share regions 2 to 4, and a fixed boundary separates them. This is the shape
that Visual Studio Code uses.

| System          | Holds                                                    | Owns            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| The shell       | The two side panels, and the editor grid between them    | The application |
| The editor grid | A split tree of editor surfaces, each with its own strip | The project     |

The title bar and the project header stay fixed above both. A fixed shell keeps one route
to every project action. A user who breaks a layout still finds Test, Pack and the way
back to the project list.

The side panels never enter the split tree. A side panel is not an editor surface: it
holds one view rather than documents, the shell names it, it hides rather than closes,
and it takes no tab drop. A tab dragged over one does nothing.

### The split tree

A node is a split or a leaf. A split holds two or more children, in a row or in a column.
A leaf is one editor surface: a tab strip over a stack of documents.

```ts
type LayoutNode =
  | {
      kind: "split";
      id: string;
      dir: "row" | "col";
      children: LayoutNode[];
      layout?: Record<string, number>;
    }
  | {
      kind: "leaf";
      id: string;
      tabs: DocumentId[];
      activeTab: DocumentId | null;
      locked?: boolean;
    };
```

`locked` is the group lock. Read [A locked group](#a-locked-group). `layout` holds the sizes
the seam library last reported, keyed by child id, and the editor never authors a number into
it. A split with no `layout` takes even shares. There is no
panel field, because every leaf is an editor surface. The side panels live in the shell,
and the game browser opens as a tab like any other document.

The shape of the tree gives each rule below, so no repair pass runs after an edit.

| Rule                                | What the tree does                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| A closed panel gives its space back | Drop the leaf, and its share goes to the sibling beside it |
| A split with one child disappears   | Replace the split with that child, and its share survives  |
| A seam resize keeps the total       | The library reports the sizes, and the tree stores them    |
| The layout fills the window         | A share is a flex value, so no pixel math runs             |
| A hole or an overlap cannot appear  | Neither one has a form in the tree                         |

The tree is JSON already, so `.ltk/editor.json` holds it without a translation.

### What resizes a seam

`react-resizable-panels` gives the seam. The library is headless, it carries no dependency
of its own, and it names React 19 as a peer. The editor keeps its own markup and its own
tokens.

| Tree               | Library                                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| A split node       | `Group`, and `orientation` comes from `dir`            |
| A child of a split | `Panel`, with an `id` and a `minSize`                  |
| A seam             | `Separator`, which carries `role="separator"` and keys |
| `layout`           | `defaultLayout` in, and `onLayoutChanged` out          |

`onLayoutChanged` reports a layout after the pointer stops, and its second argument says
whether a user caused the change. The editor stores a layout on a user change alone, so a
first mount and a window resize write nothing.

A `Panel` must be a direct child of its `Group`. A nested split therefore renders as a
`Group` inside a `Panel`, and no wrapper comes between the two.

### Panel types

Each view below is one a side panel can host. A future view joins the same list, and needs
no new layout code. The editor surface is not on the list, because it is the grid between
the panels and not a view: it appears once for each leaf of the split tree. Read
[A tab drag creates a panel](#a-tab-drag-creates-a-panel).

- Every view [the rail](#the-rail) offers the primary panel
- The file tree of the selected layer
- The asset inspector
- The merged layer view, when it arrives

### A tab drag creates a panel

A user drags a tab by its handle and drops it on the boundary of a panel. The tree wraps
that leaf in a split, and the tab moves into the new leaf. The new seam resizes like every
other seam.

- A drop on the top, the bottom, the left or the right boundary creates a panel there
- A drop inside a panel moves the tab into the tab strip of that panel
- A panel that loses its last tab closes, and the layout gives its space back
- Each panel holds its own tab strip and its own active tab

The tab strip drags with `@dnd-kit` today. The four boundaries of a leaf become drop
targets of the same kind, so one drag reaches both a reorder and a split.

The keyboard reaches the same gesture. A focused tab starts a drag on `Space`, the arrow
keys step it to the neighbouring strip position, another group or an edge, `Space` drops it
and `Escape` gives it up. The drop resolves through the same rules a pointer drop does, so a
keyboard move reaches every target a pointer move reaches. A tab announces itself as
draggable, which is what tells a reader the gesture is there at all.

An explorer item drags onto the same zones and opens rather than moves. Read
[An item is a drag source](#an-item-is-a-drag-source).

This gesture answers the question of how many times a panel type appears. The editor
surface appears as many times as the user drags, because a split is the purpose of the
gesture. Every other panel type appears once, because none of them holds a tab.

A user reaches a side by side read without a preset and without a layout dialog. Two layers
compare this way, and so do two [scoped game browsers](#scope-to-one-archive).

### A pinned tab

A pinned tab leads its strip and a batch close passes it over. The pin is the reader saying
which of the open documents the session is about, so the rest can churn around it.

The strip draws the pinned run first, then a divider, then everything else. A drag settles
against that divider rather than through it, so the two runs never interleave.

| Gesture                                     | What a pinned tab does                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Close Others, Close to the Right, Close All | Passes it over                                   |
| The tab's own **Close**                     | Closes it, since the item names this tab         |
| A middle click                              | Nothing. The gesture is quick and undoes nowhere |
| The button at the tab's right end           | Unpins rather than closes                        |
| A drag inside its own strip                 | Reorders inside the pinned run                   |
| A drag into another group                   | Carries the pin, and lands in that group's run   |

**A pin makes an ephemeral tab permanent.** A preview tab is the one the next open replaces,
and a pin is the opposite claim, so pinning one ends its ephemeral role.

**A batch close with nothing to close reads as disabled.** Close Others over a strip whose
other tabs are all pinned would do nothing, so the item is greyed rather than silent.

**A reset gathers the pinned tabs to the front.** The merge takes each strip whole, which
would leave the second group's pinned tabs behind the first group's ordinary ones.

The pin belongs to the document and to the project. `.ltk/editor.json` holds the list beside
the tabs, so a project opens pinned the way it was left. A pin dies with the tab it is on:
closing a pinned document drops it.

| Where the control is              | What it reads                       |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| The tab's right end, while pinned | A filled pin, in place of the close |
| A tab's context menu              | Pin, and Unpin while pinned         |
| The command bar, under View       | Pin the tab                         |

### A locked group

A locked group takes a document only from a gesture that names it. Every other open lands
somewhere else, so an arrangement a user built survives a walk through a tree.

This is the cost the split tree carries without it. A reader opens a bin beside the file
list, then walks the list, and every file the walk opens lands on top of the bin. The lock is
what holds a reference open beside the work.

| Gesture                                      | What a locked group does                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| An open from a tree, the sidebar or the bar  | Passes it by                                |
| A preview                                    | Passes it by, and keeps its own preview tab |
| A tab dropped on its strip or its middle     | Takes it, because the drop named the group  |
| Split Right, Split Down, Open beside         | Land where they landed before               |
| A close, a reorder, an activate, a seam drag | Unchanged                                   |

**An open it passes by lands in the next group that takes one**, in reading order, and in a
group of its own to the right when every group is locked. That last case is the only way a
lock puts a group on screen.

**A preview tab in a locked group becomes permanent.** The next preview cannot replace it
where it sits, so it stops being the one ephemeral tab and the replacement opens elsewhere.

**An empty group takes a document either way.** A lock is what a group holds against a stray
open, and a group holding nothing has nothing to hold. A group that loses its last tab closes
and takes its lock with it, so the strip shows the control only while it holds a tab.

**A reset unlocks.** It merges every strip into one, and one group has nothing to hold itself
against.

The lock belongs to the group and to the project. `.ltk/editor.json` holds it beside the
tabs, so a project opens locked the way it was left.

| Where the control is           | What it reads                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| The right end of the tab strip | A padlock, on hover and at all times while locked |
| A tab's context menu           | Lock Group, and Unlock Group while locked         |
| The command bar, under View    | Lock the group                                    |

### Maximizing a panel

A double click on a kept tab maximizes its panel. The panel fills the editor grid, and the rest of
the tree waits behind it. A second double click on the tab restores the tree, and so does Esc where
nothing inside the panel takes the key. A double click on a replaceable tab keeps it, per
[Preview tabs](#preview-tabs), and the next one maximizes.

Maximizing writes nothing to the tree, and a restart opens the arranged grid. A maximized panel
takes no drop on its edges. The shells of the bin editor maximize a pane by the same gesture, per
[How the panes are arranged](BIN_EDITOR.md#how-the-panes-are-arranged).

### Two libraries that do not fit

**`react-grid-layout`.** An earlier draft of this section named it. Its compaction moves a
panel and never grows one, so a closed panel leaves a hole where the rule above asks for
the space back. A resize changes one panel and pushes its neighbor, which is not a seam.
Its drop path reads native drag events, and the tab strip sends pointer events.

**`dockview`.** It gives the docking model that this section describes. It is not headless,
and it locks part of its feature set, so the editor cannot carry its own theme through it.

### Presets

A custom layout works against the second goal of this document, because it removes the one
clear place for each action. Named presets answer that cost.

| Preset   | Arrangement                                                      |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default  | The three regions of the Layout section, in that order           |
| Textures | A wide preview, a small tree, and the inspector below it         |
| Strings  | The string table at full width, and the project map only         |
| Compare  | Two editor surfaces beside each other, for a layer to layer read |

A preset is a grid tree plus the shell's own settings, so each row of this table is one
value in the application. A new user gets the Default preset and never opens the layout
controls. A reset control returns any layout to Default.

### What it replaces

Nothing. The layout control in the project header sets which side each side panel takes and
whether one shows, and those are the shell's questions. The split tree governs the editor
grid alone, so the two answer different regions. The control gains one action, which is
the reset of the grid.

### Where a layout belongs

A layout belongs to the project, and not to the whole application. Each project opens with
the arrangement that its own work needs.

A project has a shape. A skin project is texture work and wants a wide preview. A
localization project is table work and wants the string table at full width. The same
modder wants a different arrangement in each of the two, so one application-wide layout
serves the second project badly.

The tab strip is already per project, and the layout joins it. Together the two answer one
question, which is "where did I leave this project?"

#### The project directory holds it

The manager writes the layout into a `.ltk` directory of the project.

```
Charizard Smolder X/
├─ .ltk/
│  └─ editor.json
├─ content/
└─ mod.config.json
```

`editor.json` is JSON, because `mod.config.json` is JSON and one project does not need two
formats. `.ltk` is a directory and not a dotfile, so the per-project state that comes later
joins it without a second name at the project root.

A layout in the project directory travels. A project on a shared drive, in a Git repository
or out of a backup opens with the arrangement that it had.

**The tab strip moves with it.** The strip lived in browser storage, under the project path
as its key. A rename needed code to follow that key, and a second machine got nothing at
all. The `.ltk` directory removes both faults, so `editor.json` holds the open documents
and the active tab as well as the layout. A project that predates the file seeds it from
its browser storage entry on the first open, and the entry itself is left in place.

#### The cost, and the answer to it

A modder who prefers one arrangement everywhere must build it again in each new project.
This cost is the reason that the earlier decision put the layout in the application.

A default answers the cost. The application keeps one default layout, a new project starts
from a copy of it, and a control writes the current layout back as the new default. The
modder arranges the panels one time, and every later project opens that way.

## Ideas for review

These are proposals. None is a decision.

**A merged view.** A read-only tree that shows the result of every layer together, and
names the layer that wins for each path. A modder cannot answer "which file does the game
get?" today without a manual comparison. The **Also in layer** field of the inspector
answers this question for one file, and this view answers it for the whole project.

**A diff between layers.** Two layers hold the same path. A diff shows what one changes
against the other.

**A Git section in the primary side panel.** The changed files, a stage control and a
commit box, in the shape that Visual Studio Code uses.

**An empty state that teaches.** Each empty section names the first action in plain words,
and not only a button. This is the cheapest help for a new modder.

**A copy from the palette.** `Alt+Enter` on a game row of the project bar copies that file
into the selected layer, for the modder who holds the path as a string and wants the file
and not a preview. The bar already reads `Ctrl+Enter` for a split, so the modifier has a
home.

**A drag out of the window.** A game file dropped on the desktop extracts it. The item is a
drag source already, and the operating system is one more target, through a drag-out plugin
for Tauri. The payload is the same list, and the target runs
[the extract](#extract-to-disk) with the drop as the destination and Flat as the layout.

## Open questions

1. Does the `.ltk` directory belong in version control? A layout is a work habit, and the
   source control section covers the declarative data alone.
2. Does a back onto a document that was closed reopen it, or does the entry drop? The
   proposal drops it, so a back never lands on a tab that is gone. A reopen is the other
   reading, and it is what a user who closed a preview by mistake would want.
3. Which key opens the bar on a keyboard that is not `Ctrl`-based? The Linux and macOS
   builds are not in scope yet, and `Ctrl+P` is a Windows answer.
4. The sort belongs to each tab within its project. The sidebar keeps separate ordering.
5. Does a thumbnail survive a scroll? Nothing is stored today. A bounded cache of encoded
   thumbnails is the escalation, and a measurement should buy it.
6. Does an extract obey the filter chips? The proposal says yes, because the explorer shows
   what the extract writes and the dialog names the chips. The other reading extracts the
   whole directory and leaves the chips to the view.
7. Where does the first extract go? The proposal remembers the last folder and starts with
   none, so the first extract asks. A default under the user's documents is the other
   reading, and it saves one click once.

| Where does the game browser open?                | A tab, and a panel type for either side panel        |
| Which hash table resolves a WAD path?            | The mimir shared cache                               |
| How many game index caches does the app keep?    | One, and it is the memory-mapped one                 |
| Does the root browser show a row for an archive? | No. The Game WADs tab is where one opens             |
| Which archives does the game index cover?        | Every archive under `DATA/FINAL`, recursed           |
| How many game browsers open at one time?         | One for the game, and one for each archive           |
| Can one panel type appear more than one time?    | The editor surface can, by a tab drag                |
| Which model arranges the panels?                 | A split tree, and not a free-form grid               |
| Which library resizes a seam?                    | `react-resizable-panels`, which is headless          |
| Does a project with one filled panel show two?   | It cannot, because the layout is per project         |
| Do the side panels enter the split tree?         | No. They stay the shell's, as in Visual Studio Code  |
| Where do a second surface's tabs go on a reset?  | Into the surviving strip, in reading order           |
| Does an explorer have a current directory?       | Yes. The location, and the breadcrumb names it       |
| How many views does an explorer draw?            | Three. The tree, the grid and the details list       |
| Where does a tile's thumbnail come from?         | The `ltk-asset` scheme, at the tile's own width      |
| Which rows does a filter box read?               | The location, and everything below it                |
| Does a leaf ever draw a second row of chrome?    | The explorers do. A location is not a title          |
| Can the palette find a bin object by its path?   | Yes, once the object index lands                     |
| Which side holds the object names?               | The mimir cache. The manager stores no second copy   |
| Does `ltk_meta` still block the object index?    | No. `BinStream::entries` is the header scan          |
| Does the object cache hold resolved names?       | No. 359,095 hashes resolve at load in 200ms          |
| Does the object index read the project's bins?   | Yes, and that half ships second                      |
| Which side matches the project's objects?        | The frontend, on the content scan's payload          |
| Does a bin's dependency list earn a stored edge? | Once **#190** reads one. Nothing stores one today    |
| Does the object build ride the game index build? | No. Its own build, over the built game index         |
| Does the object index read a `PTCH`?             | Yes, eagerly, for the objects a patch bin adds       |
| When does the object build run?                  | At startup, with the Objects switch on               |
| Does one object earn one row, or one per file?   | One per declaring file. The source tells them apart  |
| Can a query filter by class?                     | Yes. `class:` prefix or hex, with completions on Tab |
| Is an unnamed chunk read by the object build?    | Yes, when its first bytes say bin                    |
| Which reader wants the dependency graph?         | Not search. The link picker and the problems list    |
| Does the tree gain the grid's multi-select?      | Yes. A selected directory is every file below it     |
| Does a shared chunk land under every archive?    | No. One file, under the archive the copy chooses     |
| Does `Ctrl+C` reach the system clipboard?        | Yes, with the chunk paths, one on each line          |
| Is the conflict answer a setting?                | Yes. Ask, Skip or Replace, and Ask is the default    |
| Does the layer file tree take the selection now? | No. The copy runs from the game into the mod         |
| How does an unnamed chunk get an extension?      | `LeagueFileKind::identify_from_bytes`, as wadtools   |
| Does the selection belong to a view?             | No. To the explorer, and a view switch keeps it      |
| What does an item dropped on a surface do?       | Opens there. A tab moves, and an item opens          |
| Which crate holds the extractor?                 | `ltk_wad`. wadtools and the manager both drive it    |
| Does an extract keep the game paths?             | Yes by default, and a switch flattens it             |
| How does the crate recover a chunk's name?       | A byte scan of the bins, found by their first block  |
| Where do the manager's checks collect?           | One Problems panel, on a rule for each check         |
| What repairs a mod that a game patch broke?      | Problems, on a migration table shipped in the build  |
