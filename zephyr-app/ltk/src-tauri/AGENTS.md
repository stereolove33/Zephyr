# Backend (Rust) - `src-tauri/src/`

Conventions for the Rust side. Repo-wide guidance lives in the root `AGENTS.md`. This file also
governs `crates/ltk-manager-core/`, whose `AGENTS.md` points here.

## Workspace Crates

| Crate                     | Knows about                       | Depends on                  | License            |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------ |

`ritoclient` is an external dependency rather than a workspace member, pinned to a git rev in the
root `Cargo.toml` until it ships on crates.io. It is **Apache-2.0**, where this workspace is
GPL-3.0-or-later - not an oversight to tidy. Re-run `pnpm generate:licenses` after any dependency
is added or relicensed.

`hexshade` knows no bin, no asset and no `AppError`. It reaches the shader cache through its own
`ShaderSource` trait, which the game crate implements over `AssetLookup`, and `dxbc-spirv-sys`
is its FFI crate, named for the library it binds.

`ltk-manager-game` sits above core. Core owns the open document, the names and where an asset
lives, and the game crate owns the classes read out of them: the map, material, skin, VFX and
spell reads. Core never calls it, so nothing core holds knows what a `MapContainer` is. The VFX
template catalog stays in core, because a new object of a declared document starts from it. The
game crate reads a bin through what `bin_document` exports for that (`struct_of`, `items`,
`entries`, `struct_entries`, `optional`, `leaf`, `link`, `text`, `boolean`, `float`, `unsigned`,
`vector4` and the rest, `Namer`, `Locator`, `object_at`) and never through `ltk_meta` matches of
its own. The two exceptions read the kind itself: the VFX resolve turns every kind into its tree,
and the spell read reports a field of the wrong kind. A field or class hash is
`hashing::named("…")` wherever its name is known. A type of it that crosses IPC derives under its
own `ts` feature, which takes core's.

`atlas` sits above the game crate and holds the UI editor's backend: a view controller resolved
into its scenes and elements, the sprite manifest, the UI programs and the sheet a mod packs. It
reads a bin the same way the game crate does, and reaches the shader cache through the game
crate's `AssetChunks`.

Dependencies point one way only. `ritoclient` takes plain arguments (`Option<&Path>`) and reports
through its own `LaunchObserver` and `SessionObserver` traits - it must never learn about `Config`,
`EventSink` or `AppError`. `core/src/launcher/` is the seam that adapts between them, and
`launcher/types.rs` mirrors every launch shape that crosses IPC so an upstream rename is a compile
error there rather than a frontend union that quietly disagrees.

Read-only calls to the Riot Client return `Option`, never `Result`: every caller has a fallback,
and "the client didn't answer" is not a failure worth showing a user. Only launching, closing and
building a launcher return `LauncherError`.

## IPC

A service is an inline Tauri plugin, on `tauri-specta` (ADR-0029, ADR-0059). `services/table.rs`
names each service and its commands once, and both `build.rs` and `services/mod.rs` read it. A
command carries `#[tauri::command]` and `#[specta::specta]`, returns `IpcResult<T>`, and joins its
service's row, or the row's `debug:` list when only a debug build registers it. Every command
belongs to a service. An event payload no command reaches is named once with `.typ::<T>()` in
`ipc::builder`.

A command that shows, hides, focuses or minimizes a window is `async`. Tauri runs a sync plugin
command on the main thread while it holds the plugin store's lock, and the window event the call
raises waits for that same lock, so the app hangs.

What more than one service uses lives in `services/shared/`: `off_thread`, the asset and document
reads, the `InFlight` slot and `overtaken` check, and the `Library` and `Workshop` arguments, which
stand in for the states a library or workshop command takes and which a binding leaves out.

A type that crosses IPC derives `specta::Type` under its crate's `ts` feature.
`pnpm generate:types` writes every type to `src/lib/bindings.ts`, and each service's commands to
`src/lib/ipc/<service>.ts`. `src/lib/tauri.ts`
wraps each generated command in the `api` map and re-exports the types, with the serialize half of
a phase-split type under its plain name. A test matches an invoke on `commandNames` from
`src/test/commandNames.ts`, never on a string.

## Filesystem

Filesystem calls go through `fs_err`, aliased per module as `use fs_err as fs;`. The error names
the path and the operation, where `std::fs` reports the OS text alone, and `AppError::Io` carries
that message to a user unchanged. `clippy.toml` holds the list that keeps a bare `std::fs` call,
or the `Path` method that reaches the same syscall, out.

## Tests

Unit tests live in a file of their own. A module keeps `#[cfg(test)] mod tests;` as its last item
and the suite moves next to it - `hashtables.rs` to `hashtables/tests.rs`, `problems/mod.rs` to
`problems/tests.rs`. The module is still a child, so `use super::*` reaches the private items it
always did.

What this buys is a production file that is only production code, and a suite that can grow
without burying it. Leave a test inline only where it is a few lines that read as part of the
thing they check, such as a round-trip beside the conversion it exercises.

## Patcher

`patcher/` owns patcher lifecycle (start/stop/status) and thread management with an
`Arc<AtomicBool>` stop flag. `patcher/injector.rs` spawns and supervises the external
`cslol-host.exe` injection host over a stdin/stdout line protocol (`patcher/host.rs`). The
overlay/prefix dir is sent via a `config prefix` command, **not** as an argv. The host internally
drives `cslol-inj.exe`, and with `--elevate` (auto-enabled when League runs as admin) it bridges to
a high-integrity worker via UAC.

## State

Three Tauri-managed states:

- `SettingsState` - App settings (league path, storage path, theme). Access via `State<SettingsState>`, lock with `.0.lock().clone()`.
- `PatcherState` - Patcher thread handle and stop flag. Access via `State<PatcherState>`.
- `LauncherState` - The one `LeagueLauncher`, built at startup. It holds the session watcher and
  the window hider, which outlive the command that started them, so `save_settings` calls
  `reconfigure` rather than rebuilding it.
