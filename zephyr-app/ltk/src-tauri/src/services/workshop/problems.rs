//! The problems panel's IPC: analyze, fix, undo, and a project's restore points.
//!
//! A run is held in memory rather than returned and forgotten, because a fix
//! names the problems of a run the backend made. Anything that writes
//! invalidates that state, so the panel's next read re-runs the rules over the
//! files as they are now.
