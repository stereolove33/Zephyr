// a turbofish that exists only because the read happens before the spawn.
// `config()` is a lock and a clone, so it is at home on a blocking thread. The
// ones to look at are `import_cslol_mods` and `rebuild_overlay`, whose setup
// also runs `reject_if_patcher_running` - moving that guard across the thread
// hop widens a window this refactor should not widen quietly.
